  abstract = {Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) can be formed between a variety of quaternary ammonium salts and carboxylic acids. The physical properties are significantly affected by the structure of the carboxylic acid but the phase behavior of the mixtures can be simply modeled by taking account of the mole fraction of carboxylic acid in the mixture. The physical properties such as viscosity, conductivity, and surface tension of these DES are similar to ambient temperature ionic liquids and insight into the cause of these properties is gained using hole-theory. It is shown that the conductivity and viscosity of these liquids is controlled by ion mobility and the availability of voids of suitable dimensions, and this is consistent with the fluidity of other ionic liquids and molten salts. The DES are also shown to be good solvents for metal oxides, which could have potential application for metal extraction.}

Herein we review various works on the electrochemical fabrication of graphene materials specifically through the use of electrochemical intercalation and exfoliation of a graphite source electrode, focusing on the quality and purity of products formed. We categorise the most significant works in terms of anodic and cathodic control, highlighting the merits of the respective approaches, as well as indicating the challenges associated with both procedures.}

The surface chemistry of the samples was studied by measuring the point of zero charge (pHpzc) and by temperature programmed desorption (TPD). The activated carbons obtained contained higher amounts of basic functional groups. Their textural and surface chemistry characteristics make them highly suitable for adsorbing anionic dyes of large molecular size, such as Congo red. The adsorption kinetics was found to conform closely to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. To determine the adsorption mechanism, the kinetic data were also analyzed using the Weber and Morris intraparticle diffusion model and the Boyd model to distinguish between the pore and film diffusion steps. The equilibrium isotherms were of the Langmuir isotherm type. The efficiency of the low-cost ACs prepared for the removal of Congo red dye was similar to that reported in the literature for coal-based ACs and greater than that of other low-cost ACs.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Lithium-based batteries have the potential to undergo thermal runaway (TR), during which mixtures of gases are released. The purpose of this study was to assess the explosibility of the gaseous emission from LIBs of an NMC-based cathode during thermal runaway. In the current project, a series of pouch lithium-based battery cells was exposed to abuse conditions (thermal) to study the total amount of gases released and the composition of the gas mixture. First, the battery cells were placed in a closed vessel, and the pressure and temperature rise inside the vessel were measured. In a second step, the composition of gases was analysed using a Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. We found that the amount of released gases was up to 102 \textpm{} 4 L, with a clear dependence on the battery capacity. This study showed that the concentration of gaseous emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6), and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) increased with higher cell capacity. Of the five studied flammable gases, the maximum concentrations of carbon monoxide (16.85 vol\%), methane (7.6 vol\%), and ethylene (7.86 vol\%) were identified to be within their explosible range. Applying Le Chatelier's law, a calculated lower explosion limit (LEL) of 7\% in volume fraction was obtained for the gas mixture. The upper explosion limit (UEL) of the gas mixture was also found to be 31\% in volume. A filter comprising pyrobubbles was used for the removal of the studied gas components released during the thermal abuse. The investigation revealed that the pyrobubbles filter was highly effect in the removal of HCN (up to 94\% removal) and CO2 (up to 100\% removal). Herein, we report the dependency of the method of thermal runaway trigger on the measured maximum temperature.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This paper determines the effect of adding water to choline chloride based deep eutectic solvents on transition metal speciation, a common method for reducing their viscosity, using UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy. Even small amounts of water ({$<$} 5 \%) were seen to cause a hypsochromic shift in UV/Vis spectra, indicating a change in metal speciation. In the choline chloride -- urea solvent, the hydrolysis of the studied metals (V3+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+) was observed. In the ethylene glycol and malonic acid systems precipitation was not observed, and Mx+ - H2O interactions were generally seen to dominate above ca. 30 \% H2O. The presented results will impact metal recovery process design, where water additions to deep eutectic solvents to lower viscosity must be balanced with changes in metal speciation. This will allow for optimization of pumping systems whilst maintaining an effective process.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the challenges of explaining the behavior of porous carbons in cutting-edge applications related to energy storage, catalysis, photocatalysis, and advanced separation based on reactive adsorption. It is a summary of the outcomes of the extensive discussion which took place during the workshop ``Beyond Adsorption-II: new perspectives and challenges for nanoporous carbons,'' organized as a satellite event to the International Carbon Conference on July 20th, 2019 in New York. It is not our intention to provide a tutorial on the applications, characterization or performance testing of porous carbons; we would rather like to focus on the controversy of the results and phenomena, on the explanation of findings, and on raising concerns to the growing carbon-researching scientific community about the importance of understanding the features of nanoporous carbons by choosing an appropriate characterization technique that will bring meaningful information. We want to emphasize that nanoporous carbons have unique features ensuring them making a marked advance in science and technology. Even though recent studies have shown their potential in various emerging applications, the origin of such performance is not yet well understood. Thus, scientists are encouraged to focus on a precise characterization of porous carbons using a set of complementary techniques for triggering future technological developments.},

The fabricated electrodes were subjected to chemical and electrochemical analysis (including X-Ray fluorescence analysis, X-Ray diffraction analysis, FTIR analysis, BET analysis, FE-SEM, cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis, galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD) analysis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis). The iron incorporation activated waste tyre-derived carbon (IIAWTDC) electrode material recorded the highest performance in all the electrochemical analyses with a capacitance of 1400 F/g at 1 A/g.

It is shown that carbonization temperature does not affect much the properties of the final material, whereas the amount of KOH dictates the porosity (improving the microporous volume) and slightly affects the degree of graphitization. Adsorption of H2 at sub-atmospheric pressure showed the highest uptake (2.5\% by weight) for the material with the highest microporous volume, obtained by carbonization at 900 {$^\circ$}C with a KOH/char mass ratio of 2.0. \copyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Synthesized samples were characterized by means of TGA SEM, XRD, XRF, nitrogen low-temperature adsorption/desorption, Raman, and EDAX. Rice husk calcination yields in 18 and 14 wt\% of 1-SiO2 and 2-SiO2, correspondingly. Carbonization of rice husk followed by activation yielded about 11 wt\% of activated carbon with large specific surface area (SBET = 3292 m2 g-1). Feasibility of resulting materials as anode materials for Li-ion batteries grounded on a high theoretical capacity of silica and high charge/discharge stability of activated carbon. We present here a 2-SiO2 material with large specific surface area of 980 m2 g-1, of high purity above 99 \%, and large pore volume (1.20 cm3 g-1), which results in a reversible capacity of about 841 and 442 mAh g-1 (1st and 50th cycle) with coulombic efficiency higher than 95 \%. Activated carbon demonstrated the highest initial discharge specific capacity and stable reversible capacity after 50 cycles as 1462 and 477 mAh g-1 (1st and 50th cycle), and coulombic efficiency higher than 90 \%.},

Over the past decades, various types of carbon-based materials have been employed as electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitor application. Among them, graphene is 1 of the most widely used carbon-based materials due to its excellent properties including high surface area and excellent conductivity. To exploit more of its interesting properties, graphene is tailored to produce graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide to improve the dispersibility in water and easy to be incorporated with other materials to form binary composites or even ternary composites. Nowadays, ternary composites have attracted enormous interest as 2 materials (binary composites) cannot satisfy the requirement of the high-performance supercapacitor. Thus, many approaches have been employed to fabricate ternary composites by combining 3 different types of electroactive materials for high-performance supercapacitor application. This review focuses on the supercapacitive performance of graphene-based ternary composites with different types of active materials, ie, conducting polymers, metal oxide, and other carbon-based materials.},

Central to the SDG agenda is the vital role of business innovation in fostering positive change and promoting the triple bottom line of sustainability: people, planet, and prosperity. Many years have passed following the SDGs' inception, yet the engagement of business innovation scholarship with the SDGs remains sparse. Moreover, a comprehensive review examining the convergence of business, innovation, and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs is notably absent, constraining insights into present advancements and prospective trajectories. In this regard, this study adopts the SDGs as a lens to investigate the contribution of business innovation to sustainable development challenges and its impact on the SDG agenda. To do so, this study conducts a systematic literature review, incorporating a bibliometric analysis of articles published in top-tier business journals, to offer an integrated overview of current trends in business, innovation, and sustainability research through the lens of the SDGs. In addition, this study performs a content analysis to consolidate and synthesize relevant research in this space, resulting in a multi-dimensional framework that illustrates the intricate, dynamic interplay between the drivers, dimensions, and impacts of business innovation on sustainability and their relationship with the SDGs. In doing so, this study accentuates extant gaps, delineates profound implications, and proposes meaningful directions to advance the understanding of the intersection between business, innovation, and sustainability in the context of the SDGs.},

  abstract = {The wide adoption of lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles will require increased natural resources for the automotive industry. The expected rapid increase in batteries could result in new resource challenges and supply-chain risks. To strengthen the resilience and sustainability of automotive supply chains and reduce primary resource requirements, circular economy strategies are needed. Here we illustrate how these strategies can reduce the extraction of primary raw materials, that is, cobalt supplies. Material flow analysis is applied to understand current and future flows of cobalt embedded in electric vehicle batteries across the European Union. A reference scenario is presented and compared with four strategies: technology-driven substitution and technology-driven reduction of cobalt, new business models to stimulate battery reuse/recycling and policy-driven strategy to increase recycling. We find that new technologies provide the most promising strategies to reduce the reliance on cobalt substantially but could result in burden shifting such as an increase in nickel demand. To avoid the latter, technological developments should be combined with an efficient recycling system. We conclude that more-ambitious circular economy strategies, at both government and business levels, are urgently needed to address current and future resource challenges across the supply chain successfully.}

We adopt a 'hands-on' approach, providing practical details and procedures as derived from literature as well as from the authors' experience, in order to enable the reader to reproduce the results. Section I is devoted to 'bottom up' approaches, whereby individual constituents are pieced together into more complex structures. We consider graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) produced either by solution processing or by on-surface synthesis in ultra high vacuum (UHV), as well carbon nanomembranes (CNM). Production of a variety of GNRs with tailored band gaps and edge shapes is now possible. CNMs can be tuned in terms of porosity, crystallinity and electronic behaviour. Section II covers 'top down' techniques. These rely on breaking down of a layered precursor, in the graphene case usually natural crystals like graphite or artificially synthesized materials, such as highly oriented pyrolythic graphite, monolayers or few layers (FL) flakes. The main focus of this section is on various exfoliation techniques in a liquid media, either intercalation or liquid phase exfoliation (LPE). The choice of precursor, exfoliation method, medium as well as the control of parameters such as time or temperature are crucial. A definite choice of parameters and conditions yields a particular material with specific properties that makes it more suitable for a targeted application. We cover protocols for the graphitic precursors to graphene oxide (GO). This is an important material for a range of applications in biomedicine, energy storage, nanocomposites, etc. Hummers' and modified Hummers' methods are used to make GO that subsequently can be reduced to obtain reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with a variety of strategies. GO flakes are also employed to prepare three-dimensional (3d) low density structures, such as sponges, foams, hydro- or aerogels. The assembly of flakes into 3d structures can provide improved mechanical properties. Aerogels with a highly open structure, with interconnected hierarchical pores, can enhance the accessibility to the whole surface area, as relevant for a number of applications, such as energy storage. The main recipes to yield graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are also discussed. GICs are suitable precursors for covalent functionalization of graphene, but can also be used for the synthesis of uncharged graphene in solution. Degradation of the molecules intercalated in GICs can be triggered by high temperature treatment or microwave irradiation, creating a gas pressure surge in graphite and exfoliation. Electrochemical exfoliation by applying a voltage in an electrolyte to a graphite electrode can be tuned by varying precursors, electrolytes and potential. Graphite electrodes can be either negatively or positively intercalated to obtain GICs that are subsequently exfoliated. We also discuss the materials that can be amenable to exfoliation, by employing a theoretical data-mining approach. The exfoliation of LMs usually results in a heterogeneous dispersion of flakes with different lateral size and thickness. This is a critical bottleneck for applications, and hinders the full exploitation of GRMs produced by solution processing. The establishment of procedures to control the morphological properties of exfoliated GRMs, which also need to be industrially scalable, is one of the key needs. Section III deals with the processing of flakes. (Ultra)centrifugation techniques have thus far been the most investigated to sort GRMs following ultrasonication, shear mixing, ball milling, microfluidization, and wet-jet milling. It allows sorting by size and thickness. Inks formulated from GRM dispersions can be printed using a number of processes, from inkjet to screen printing. Each technique has specific rheological requirements, as well as geometrical constraints. The solvent choice is critical, not only for the GRM stability, but also in terms of optimizing printing on different substrates, such as glass, Si, plastic, paper, etc, all with different surface energies. Chemical modifications of such substrates is also a key step. Sections IV-VII are devoted to the growth of GRMs on various substrates and their processing after growth to place them on the surface of choice for specific applications. The substrate for graphene growth is a key determinant of the nature and quality of the resultant film. The lattice mismatch between graphene and substrate influences the resulting crystallinity. Growth on insulators, such as SiO2, typically results in films with small crystallites, whereas growth on the close-packed surfaces of metals yields highly crystalline films. Section IV outlines the growth of graphene on SiC substrates. This satisfies the requirements for electronic applications, with well-defined graphene-substrate interface, low trapped impurities and no need for transfer. It also allows graphene structures and devices to be measured directly on the growth substrate. The flatness of the substrate results in graphene with minimal strain and ripples on large areas, allowing spectroscopies and surface science to be performed. We also discuss the surface engineering by intercalation of the resulting graphene, its integration with Si-wafers and the production of nanostructures with the desired shape, with no need for patterning. Section V deals with chemical vapour deposition (CVD) onto various transition metals and on insulators. Growth on Ni results in graphitized polycrystalline films. While the thickness of these films can be optimized by controlling the deposition parameters, such as the type of hydrocarbon precursor and temperature, it is difficult to attain single layer graphene (SLG) across large areas, owing to the simultaneous nucleation/growth and solution/precipitation mechanisms. The differing characteristics of polycrystalline Ni films facilitate the growth of graphitic layers at different rates, resulting in regions with differing numbers of graphitic layers. High-quality films can be grown on Cu. Cu is available in a variety of shapes and forms, such as foils, bulks, foams, thin films on other materials and powders, making it attractive for industrial production of large area graphene films. The push to use CVD graphene in applications has also triggered a research line for the direct growth on insulators. The quality of the resulting films is lower than possible to date on metals, but enough, in terms of transmittance and resistivity, for many applications as described in section V. Transfer technologies are the focus of section VI. CVD synthesis of graphene on metals and bottom up molecular approaches require SLG to be transferred to the final target substrates. To have technological impact, the advances in production of high-quality large-area CVD graphene must be commensurate with those on transfer and placement on the final substrates. This is a prerequisite for most applications, such as touch panels, anticorrosion coatings, transparent electrodes and gas sensors etc. New strategies have improved the transferred graphene quality, making CVD graphene a feasible option for CMOS foundries. Methods based on complete etching of the metal substrate in suitable etchants, typically iron chloride, ammonium persulfate, or hydrogen chloride although reliable, are time- and resourceconsuming, with damage to graphene and production of metal and etchant residues. Electrochemical delamination in a low-concentration aqueous solution is an alternative. In this case metallic substrates can be reused. Dry transfer is less detrimental for the SLG quality, enabling a deterministic transfer. There is a large range of layered materials (LMs) beyond graphite. Only few of them have been already exfoliated and fully characterized. Section VII deals with the growth of some of these materials. Amongst them, h-BN, transition metal tri- and di-chalcogenides are of paramount importance. The growth of h-BN is at present considered essential for the development of graphene in (opto) electronic applications, as h-BN is ideal as capping layer or substrate. The interesting optical and electronic properties of TMDs also require the development of scalable methods for their production. Large scale growth using chemical/physical vapour deposition or thermal assisted conversion has been thus far limited to a small set, such as h-BN or some TMDs. Heterostructures could also be directly grown.},

  abstract = {A UV-assisted process allows full-faced or local deposition of silver domains on textiles made of natural as well as synthetic fibers, which act as nuclei for subsequent galvanic metallization. SEM and XPS analyses indicate that the process generates particulate depositions -- particles, aggregates -- of elementary silver. Masking the UV irradiation confines silver deposition strictly to the exposed areas thus allowing patterning. Adhesion of the deposited silver is high on the studied natural fiber cotton and polyamide fibers. Adhesion on smooth and chemically inert synthethic fibers such as, e.g., poly(ethylene terephthalate) or para- and meta-aramids could be enhanced by finishing with poly(vinylamine) thus providing complex-forming amino groups. Although the process does not deposit a closed, electrically conducting layer, all studied samples could be metallized by galvanization. The resulting metal coatings exhibit high conductivity and wash stability. Following a patterned silver deposition, the subsequent galvanic metallization produced conductive patterns of identical geometry thus opening an avenue towards printed circuits on textile fabrics.},

With the advent of novel nano-carbons such as nanotubes and graphene, the ability to easily and unambiguously identify materials of varying sp2/sp3 nature in XPS spectra and images is becoming increasingly important. We present herein methods for the identification of such species in XPS images by shifting focus from the traditionally analysed C1s region to the X-ray induced carbon Auger feature. By extracting the D-Parameter from XPS data, we have generated what we refer to as ``D-Parameter Images'', that clearly identify regions of different carbon hybridisation in an image of a graphite flake mounted on carbon tape, and areas of reduced graphene oxide (GO) in a laser-scribed GO film. This method is then enhanced by multivariate analysis, a technique we call ``Multivariate Auger Feature Imaging'', where the distinction between varying sp2 carbon content on a surface is improved.}

In the search to make the waste tire pyrolysis process profitable, new applications of the pyrolytic solid products have been explored, such as for the fabrication of energy-storage devices and precursor in the synthesis of nanomaterials. In this study, waste tires powder was chemically activated using acid (H 2 SO 4) and/or alkali (KOH) to recover pyrolytic carbon black with different characteristics. H 2 SO 4 removed surface impurities more thoroughly, improving the carbon black's surface area, while KOH increased its oxygen content, which improved the carbon black's stability in water suspension. Pyrolytic carbon black was fully characterized by elemental analysis, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2 adsorption/desorption, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and {$\zeta$} potential measurement. In addition, the pyrolytic carbon black was used to explore its feasibility as a precursor for the synthesis of carbon dots; synthesized carbon dots were analyzed preliminarily by SEM and with a fluorescence microplate reader, revealing differences in their morphology and fluorescence intensity. The results presented in this study demonstrate the effect of the activating agent on pyrolytic carbon black from waste tires and provide evidence of the feasibility of using waste tires for the synthesis of nanomaterials such as carbon dots.},

This review advocates for a comprehensive strategy, combining mechanical recycling and chemical methods to manage plastic waste while emphasizing the transformative potential of carbonization and activation processes specifically. With a focus on chemical activation, this review explores the synthesis of high surface area activated carbon (AC) from diverse plastic sources including polyesters (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate), polyolefins (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene), and non-recyclable thermoset resins (e.g., epoxy, phenolics). The resulting AC products exhibit notable potential, with high surface areas exceeding 2000 m2 g-1 in some cases. Furthermore, the adsorptive behavior of the plastic derived ACs are discussed with respect to common pollutants such as dyes and CO2 in addition to emerging pollutants, such as micro/nano-plastics. Overall, this work highlights carbonization and chemical activation as important upcycling methods for plastic wastes that may otherwise end up in landfills or spills into the environment. Given the urgency of plastic waste disposal, it is recommended that the feasibility and scalability of plastic-derived AC production is explored in future work for the potential replacement of conventional AC feedstocks derived from coal or biomass.}

  abstract = {Electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) or supercapacitors (SCs) are fast energy storage devices with high pulse efficiency and superior cyclability, which makes them useful in various applications including electronics, vehicles and grids. Aqueous SCs are considered to be more environmentally friendly than those based on organic electrolytes. Because of the corrosive nature of the aqueous environment, however, expensive electrochemically stable materials are needed for the current collectors and electrodes in aqueous SCs. This results in high costs for a given energy-storage capacity. To address this, we developed a novel low-cost aqueous SC using graphite foil as the current collector and a mix of graphene, nanographite, simple water-purification carbons and nanocellulose as electrodes. The electrodes were coated directly onto the graphite foil by using casting frames and the SCs were assembled in a pouch cell design. With this approach, we achieved a material cost reduction of greater than 90\% while maintaining approximately one-half of the specific capacitance of a commercial unit, thus demonstrating that the proposed SC can be an environmentally friendly, low-cost alternative to conventional SCs. The number of publications regarding electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) or supercapacitors (SCs) and related applications is rapidly increasing. Because of the excellent performance of SCs in handling short peak power pulses with high efficiency and their long lifetime and superior cyclability, their applications range from small consumer electronics to electric vehicles and stationary grid applications 1-5. In stationary applications, an SC is used to provide power stabilization by handling short power surges in the grid or as a buffer to compensate for the irregular supply of generated electricity from solar cells and windmills 2. In automotive applications, an SC can enhance battery life, enhance the efficiency of regenerative braking or function in combination with fuel cells to handle peak power demands 3-5. However, the high cost of SCs is a substantial issue for large-scale commercial use, thus leading to a need for environmentally safe, low-cost materials and simplified manufacturing processes 1,2,6,7. Most commercial SCs use organic electrolytes and highly porous carbon electrodes coated onto aluminum foil 1,6. The main advantage of organic electrolytes is their wide electrochemical stability window (approximately 2.7 V); however, compared with aqueous alternatives, they are, expensive, flammable and, in some cases, toxic. Although aqueous electrolytes have a narrower electrochemical stability window (approximately 1.23 V), they are nonflammable, inexpensive, have higher ion conductivity and give often rise to higher capacitance due to smaller ions 1,6,8. The favorable cost and environmental aspects of SCs with aqueous electrolytes are promising; however, the development of low-cost current collectors for such SCs poses a substantial challenge 6,8,9. The aggressive nature of the aqueous environment demands electrochemically stable materials in both the electrode and current collector to prevent oxidation leading to high interfacial resistance 9. Gheytani et al. 9 have used chromate-conversion-coated aluminum to avoid corrosion of aluminum current collectors in aqueous lithium-ion batteries. With this technique , they have maintained the current collectors' low cost compared with that of well-known corrosion-resistant materials such as titanium, stainless steel, nickel and platinum. B\'eguin et al. 6 have reported that stainless steel is most suitable for neutral (pH 7) aqueous electrolytes and that the use of acidic solutions (low pH) severely}

We propose a sustainable route to produce nanoporous carbon materials with a high-surface area from commercial graphite using a dry ball-milling procedure through a systematic study of the effects of dry ball-milling conditions on the properties of the modified carbons. The microstructure and morphology of the dry ball-milled graphite/carbon composites are characterized by BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) analysis, SEM (scanning electron microscopy), ATR-FTIR (attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) and Raman spectroscopy. As both the electrode and electrolyte play a significant role in any electrochemi-cal energy storage device, the gravimetric capacitance was measured for ball-milled material/glassy carbon (GC) composite electrodes in contact with a deep eutectic solvent (DES) containing choline chloride and ethylene glycol as hydrogen bond donor (HBD) in a 1:2 molar ratio. Electrochemical stability was tracked by measuring charge/discharge curves. Carbons with different specific surface areas were tested and the relationship between the calculated capacitance and the surface treatment method was established. A five-fold increase in gravimetric capacitance, 25.27 F{$\cdot$}g -1 (G40) against 5.45 F{$\cdot$}g -1 , was found for commercial graphene in contact with DES.

If the network is specially constructed to perform the recognition computations of a given kind of stochastic model based classifier then we obtain a method for discrimination-based training of the parameters of the models. Examples include an HMM-based word discriminator, which we call an 'Alphanet'.}

  abstract = {Ionogels offer huge potential for a number of applications including wearable electronics and soft sensors. However, their synthesis has been limited and often relies on non-renewable or non-biocompatible components. Here we present a novel two-component ionogel made using just deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and cellulose. DESs offer a non-volatile alternative to hydrogels with highly tuneable properties including conductivity and solvation of compounds with widely varying hydrophobicity. DESs can be easily made from cheap, biodegradable and biocompatible components. This research presents the characterisation of a series of soft conductive gels made from deep eutectic solvents (DESs), specifically choline chloride-urea and choline chloride-glycerol, with the sole addition of TEMPO-oxidised cellulose nanofibrils (OCNF). A more liquid-like rather than gel-like conductive material could be made by using the DES betaine-glycerol. OCNF are prepared from sustainable sources, and are non-toxic, and mild on the skin, forming gels without the need for surfactants or other gelling agents. These DES-OCNF gels are shear thinning with conductivities up to 1.7 mS cm-1at {$\sim$}26 {$^\circ$}C. Given the thousands of possible DESs, this system offers unmatched tunability and customisation for properties such as viscosity, conductivity, and yield behaviour.}

The relative percentages of carbon, oxygen, and detectable trace elements comprising the activated charcoal surfaces were determined. Analysis of the carbon core-electron binding energy region revealed the existence of one hydrocarbon state (C-H, C-C are indistinguishable) and three oxygen-containing functional states. These states were hydroxyls or ethers (C-O), carbonyls (C = O), and carboxylic acids or esters (O-C = O). The C-O functional state contributed approximately 60-70\% to the total percentage of oxygen-containing states. A very good correlation existed between the apparent areas occupied on the adsorbent surface per phenobarbital molecule and the relative percentages of the C-O functional state. Previously reported heat of displacement results for phenobarbital adsorption are now explained since the C-O state appears to be the primary site involved in the binding of phenobarbital by the activated charcoals.},

This study aims to recover lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese from a LiNi0.15Mn0.15Co0.70O2 cathode material of spent lithium-ion batteries of an electric vehicle. By utilizing systematic experimental and theoretical approaches based on the design of experiment and response surface methodology, the best leachant between HCl and H2SO4 + H2O2 and the optimal operating conditions are determined. Leaching with 1.0 M H2SO4 mixed with 0.62 wt \% H2O2 at a liquid-to-solid ratio of 25.8 mL g-1 and a temperature of 51 {$^\circ$}C for 60 min results in {$\sim$}100\% recovery of all four metals. After leaching, cobalt, nickel, and manganese are coprecipitated as Ni0.15Mn0.15Co0.70(OH)2 at pH above 11, while lithium is precipitated as lithium carbonate. These precipitates are mixed and sintered to generate a new cathode material, which is used to make a battery with high electrochemical performance. Valorization of spent lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles enables conserving natural resources and protecting ecosystems, both of which enable the long-term sustainability of the biosphere while at the same time contributing to the circular economy.},

  abstract = {Efficient recycling of valuable metals from spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with the minimized environmental footprint is prevailing among different recycling processes. However, the extensive energy consumption, associated with secondary contaminations, is one of the leading bottlenecks during thermochemical processing. Herein, low-temperature thermochemistry route was explored by thermal reduction using biomass wastes as reductants for selective recycling of valuable metals from spent LIBs based on their inherent conversion characteristics. It can be concluded from the experimental results that corn stalk exhibits better reducing capacity than saw dust and rice straw, and different metals in cathode materials (LiCoO2) of spent LIBs demonstrate different conversion pathways with the variation of reaction temperatures. Specifically, Li in waste LiCoO2 tends to be converted into Li2CO3 under reaction temperature range of 250--500 {$^\circ$}C, while Co will mainly exist as CoO (400--600 {$^\circ$}C) or Co (600--800 {$^\circ$}C). Then, the converted product of Li2CO3 can be selectively extracted by water leaching, and CoO or Co will be subjected for mild acidic leaching or magnetic separation, respectively. Detailed characterizations and thermochemical mechanism suggest that the reduction reactions are mainly controlled by one-dimensional model and different products can be obtained through regulation of reaction temperature. This win--win tactics using biomass wastes with significantly reduced roasting temperature is expected to be high-efficiency, high-selectivity and pollutant-free process for spent LIBs recycling.},

Then, comprehensive characterization and intermolecular interaction studies were carried out on these DESs. Moreover, the dissolution of REOs was achieved by taking advantage of the moderate viscosity and strong acidity of the designed DESs. The optimization experiments showed that ethylene glycol: maleic acid (EG: MA) at the molar ratio of 4: 1 exhibited considerable solvation ability for the studied REOs. The solubilities of Eu2O3 and La2O3 could reach as high as 0.168 g g-1 and 0.147 g g-1, respectively. The FTIR results showed that the dissolution was caused by H+ released from EG: MA. Oxalic acid was applied to strip the dissolved rare earths and then calcined in order to form the oxides. Moreover, REOs could be separated due to their significant solubility differences. For example, La2O3 and CeO2 were successfully separated; La2O3 was obtained with purity of 99.9\%, while Y2O3 and Sm2O3 could be enriched in the precipitation phase (with the purities of 99.97\% and 99.94\%, respectively). Recycling of the employed DESs for reuse in rare earth separation was also demonstrated. The reported separation process illustrates the potential of the Br\o nsted acidic deep eutectic solvents for dissolving and processing REOs.}

Harmful substances in spent LIBs can pollute the environment and threaten human health. A sustainable technology should be developed to recycle the spent LIBs. Accordingly, a new environmentally friendly hydro-metallurgical process was proposed for leaching Li, Co, Ni, and Mn from spent LIBs using sulfuric acid with L-ascorbic acid as a reductant. Over the leaching process, several parameters, including sulfuric acid and L-ascorbic acid concentrations, solid to liquid ratio, temperature and time were systematically investigated. The maximum recovery efficiencies of Li, Co, Ni, and Mn were as high as 99.69\%, 99.56\%, 99.60\%, and 99.87\% under the optimized conditions (C(H2SO4 concentration) = 1.5 mol/L, C(C6H8O6 concentration) = 0.25 mol/L, the agitation speed was 300 r/min, the liquid--solid ratio was 15 mL/g, and the temperature was 333 K for 60 min), respectively. The synergistic mechanism was analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy of the structure of cathode materials, residues, and leachate. The analysis results indicate that the dissolution rate of Ni, Mn, and Co was significantly improved under the condition of adding L-ascorbic acid as a reducing agent. Finally, 98.96 of Ni, 99.57\% of Mn, 99.76\% of Co, and 89.81\% of Li were recovered in the form of C8H14N4NiO4, MnCO3, CoC2O4, and Li2CO3 through precipitation-solvent extraction methods.},

Three types of GTR with different content of organic compounds (elastomers, plasticizers, etc.), carbon black and ash have been studied. The chemical structure of GTR before and after a microwave devulcanization process was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, the efficiency of the microwave devulcanization conducted at different treatment time was evaluated based on the values of crosslinking density and sol fraction content. FTIR spectroscopy results showed that devulcanization of GTR causes a decrease in carbon black with generation of CO2 due to its thermo oxidation, a decrease in the structural groups related to elastomeric components (mainly methylene and methine) and a breaking of CS groups and SS bridges. The presented results indicate the strong correlation between the content of SiO2 in the GTR and the achieved degree of devulcanization. It was observed that GTRs with a high content of SiO2 are devulcanized more easily than the samples with low content of SiO2, which suggest that the presence of silica fillers improve microwave devulcanization efficiency.},

S0 is frequently invoked as a biomineralization product generated by enzymatic oxidation of hydrogen sulfide and polysulfides. Here we show the formation of S0 encapsulated in nanometre to micrometre-scale tubular and spherical organic structures that self-assemble in sulfide gradient environments in the absence of any direct biological activity. The morphology and composition of these carbon/sulfur microstructures so closely resemble microbial cellular and extracellular structures that new caution must be applied to the interpretation of putative microbial biosignatures in the fossil record. These reactions between sulfide and organic matter have important implications for our understanding of S0 mineralization processes and sulfur interactions with organic carbon in the environment. They furthermore provide a new pathway for the synthesis of carbon-sulfur nanocomposites for energy storage technologies. Organic materials mineralized with sulfur are considered to be a product of biological activity in natural environments and the fossil record. Here, Cosmidis and Templeton show that sulfide can abiotically drive the self-assembly of organic carbon microstructures mineralized with elemental sulfur.},

However, salt is a critical ingredient in breadmaking, and its reduction can have a negative impact on bread quality. In order to respond to the World Health Organization (WHO)'s recommendation to reduce dietary salt intake, this research aims to develop a bread recipe "reduced" in salt (sodium chloride or SC) by -50 \% and partly substituted by choline chloride (CC). The effect of CC on the properties of bread was studied during baking, cooling and storage of bread. It was observed that partially substituting SC with CC led to an improvement in bread texture. Indeed, CC bread was technologically similar to the control bread. In aqueous solution, CC behaves like an ionic liquid and causes a reorganization of the internal structure of the starch grain. As a result, the staling study highlighted the positive effect of CC on bread texture and on the starch retrogradation. CC limited amylopectin recrystallization by reducing water availability in the medium, consequently slowing down the staling of the bread.},

  abstract = {Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) are a novel class of solvents with potential industrial applications in separation processes, chemical reactions, metal recovery and metal finishing processes such as electrodeposition and electropolishing. Macroscopic physical properties such as viscosity, conductivity, eutectic composition and surface tension are already available for several DESs, but the microscopic transport properties for this class of compounds are not well understood and the literature lacks experimental data that could give a better insight into the understanding of such properties. This paper presents the first pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR) study of DESs. Several choline chloride based DESs were chosen as experimental samples, each of them with a different associated hydrogen bond donor. The molecular equilibrium self-diffusion coefficient of both the choline cation and hydrogen bond donor was probed using a standard stimulated echo PFG-NMR pulse sequence. It is shown that the increasing temperature leads to a weaker interaction between the choline cation and the correspondent hydrogen bond donor. The self-diffusion coefficients of the samples obey an Arrhenius law temperature-dependence, with values of self-diffusivity in the range of [10-10-10-13 m2 s-1]. In addition, the results also highlight that the molecular structure of the hydrogen bond donor can greatly affect the mobility of the whole system. While for ethaline, glyceline and reline the choline cation diffuses slower than the associated hydrogen bond donor, reflecting the trend of molecular size and molecular weight, the opposite behaviour is observed for maline, in which the hydrogen bond donor, i.e. malonic acid, diffuses slower than the choline cation, with self-diffusion coefficients values of the order of 10-13 m 2 s-1 at room temperature, which are remarkably low values for a liquid. This is believed to be due to the formation of extensive dimer chains between malonic acid molecules, which restricts the mobility of the whole system at low temperature ({$<$}30{$^\circ$}C), with malonic acid and choline chloride having almost identical diffusivity values. Diffusion and viscosity data were combined together to gain insights into the diffusion mechanism, which was found to be the same as for ionic liquids with discrete anions. \copyright{} 2011 the Owner Societies.}

  abstract = {Approximately 36 million tons of waste plastics are generated in the United States each year, most of which are discharged into the environment and end in landfills. This is potentially a serious threat to the ecosystem and human health. Considering that the production of liquid fuels and chemicals from waste plastics is difficult to make profits and achieve zero carbon emissions, transforming waste plastics into high-quality carbon materials becomes more attractive. In this review, the production of carbon nanomaterials from different plastic materials is comprehensively discussed by an extensive list of processes developed in the past years. We show how the reactor design, catalyst types, and pyrolysis/catalysis temperature affect carbon nanomaterials' quality. In terms of catalysts, the variety of metals and supports, metal particle size, metal-support interaction, and calcination temperatures have changed the carbon nanomaterials' morphology, geometrical shape, and yield, so these parameters should be fine-tuned to improve the carbon quality. Furthermore, the existing characterization techniques for carbon materials are summaried and the potential applications of the carbon materials are outlooked. Although some satisfactory progress has been achieved, many fundamental research topics and applications, such as the effect of impurities, large-scale carbon quality evaluation, and potential application scenarios, still require lots of future effort. The plastics-to-carbon materials technology is very open for further research and is considered a promising route for recycling plastics in a more economical and environmentally friendly manner.},

All of the thiol mixtures studied showed a higher affinity and selectivity for late transition metals and the physical properties of the mixtures were improved compared to their alcohol analogues (i.e. lower viscosity, wider liquid range). The metal solubility was assessed via determination of the final concentration of the metal oxides dissolved in thiol mixtures via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The thiol function selectively improved the solubilities of the late transition metal oxides (i.e. copper and zinc), which are valuable metals often present as residue in industrial waste. The solubility of iron oxides was much lower than that of the valuable metals, which is a significant benefit in industrial applications. The different solubilization behaviour of metal oxides in the thiol and alcohol mixtures was further investigated via UV-vis absorption and infrared spectroscopy. This study allowed the potential of these deep-eutectic solvents for the selective recovery of metals to be assessed.}

However, there is still intense debate surrounding the criteria for determining the electrochemical behavior involved in Faradaic reactions, as the issue is often complicated by the electrochemical signals produced by various electrode materials and their different physicochemical properties. The difficulty lies in the inability to determine which electrode type (battery vs. pseudocapacitor) these materials belong to via simple binary classification. To overcome this difficulty, we apply supervised machine learning for image classification to electrochemical shape analysis (over 5500 Cyclic Voltammetry curves and 2900 Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge curves), with the predicted confidence percentage reflecting the shape trend of the curve and thus defined as a manufacturer. It's called ``capacitive tendency''. This predictor not only transcends the limitations of human-based classification but also provides statistical trends regarding electrochemical behavior. Of note, and of particular importance to the electrochemical energy storage community, which publishes over a hundred articles per week, we have created an online tool to easily categorize their data.},

The old practice of landfilling is out of use due to the rising land costs, environmental concerns, fire risks and the possibility of proliferation of mosquitoes and other disease-carrying vectors. Devulcanization is shown to be an effective technique for making rubbers to flow and to be remolded. However, this process not only breaks down sulphur links, but also creates new other bonds, modifying the structure of the material as a whole. In order to help understand structural modifications of ground tire rubbers (GTR) as a result of devulcanization by microwaves, this work proposes an in-depth study of the chemical modifications, flow and thermo-oxidative degradation behavior as a function of the exposure time of the GTR to microwaves. An important conclusion is that the final temperature reached by the sample is the primary factor responsible for the success of the process. Depending on the final temperature of the sample, different types of sulphur bonds can be broken. During the treatment, there is a balance between break down and formation of new bonds. Therefore, it is important to control the process carefully in order to avoid degradation of the main chains. Tires usually are composed of a mixture of synthetic and natural rubbers, wherein natural rubbers could be more degraded by microwaves because carbon black is mainly found on this phase.},

This process has four major application areas: (i) production of carbon materials, (ii) fabrication of pre-patterned micro and nano carbon-based structures, (iii) fragmentation of complex organic molecules for analytical purposes and (iv) waste treatment. While the underlying process principles remain the same in all cases, the target products differ owing to the phase and composition of the organic precursor, heat-treatment temperature, influence of catalysts and the presence of post-pyrolysis steps during heat-treatment. Due to its fundamental nature, pyrolysis is often studied in the context of one particular application rather than as an independent operation. In this review article, an effort is made to understand each aspect of pyrolysis in a comprehensive fashion, ensuring that all state-of-the-art applications are approached from the core process parameters that influence the ensuing product. Representative publications from recent years for each application are reviewed and analyzed. Some classical scientific findings that laid the foundation of the modern-day carbon material production methods are also revisited. In addition, classification of pyrolysis, its history and nomenclature and the plausible integration of different application areas are discussed.}

  abstract = {To design safe and electrochemically stable electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries, this study describes the synthesis and the utilization of new deep eutectic solvents (DESs) based on the mixture of 2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide (TFA) with a lithium salt (LiTFSI, lithium bis[(trifluoromethane)sulfonyl]imide). These prepared DESs were characterized in terms of thermal properties, ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical properties. Based on the appearance of the product and DSC measurements, it appears that this system is liquid at room temperature for LiTFSI mole fraction ranging from 0.25 to 0.5. At {$\chi$}LiTFSI = 0.25, DESs exhibited favorable electrolyte properties, such as thermal stability (up to 148 {$^\circ$}C), relatively low viscosity (42.2 mPa.s at 30 {$^\circ$}C), high ionic conductivity (1.5 mS.cm-1 at 30 {$^\circ$}C), and quite large electrochemical stability window up to 4.9-5.3 V. With these interesting properties, selected DES was diluted with slight amount of ethylene carbonate (EC). Different amounts of EC (x = 0-30 \%wt) were used to form hybrid electrolytes for battery testing with high voltage LiMn2O4 cathode and Li anode. The addition of the EC solvent into DES expectedly aims at enhancing the battery cycling performance at room temperature due to reducing the viscosity. Preliminary results tests clearly show that LiTFSI-based DES can be successfully introduced as an electrolyte in the lithium-ion batteries cell with a LiMn2O4 cathode material. Among all of the studied electrolytes, DES (LiTFSI: TFA = 4:1 + 10 \%wt EC) is the most promising. The EC-based system exhibited a good specific capacity of 102 mAh.g-1 at C/10 with the theoretical capacity of 148 mAh.g-1 and a good cycling behavior maintaining at 84\% after 50 cycles.}

  abstract = {Some recent developments in the preparation of biomass carbon electrodes (CEs) using various biomass residues for application in energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, are presented in this work. The application of biomass residues as the primary precursor for the production of CEs has been increasing over the last years due to it being a renewable source with comparably low processing cost, providing prerequisites for a process that is economically and technically sustainable. Electrochemical energy storage technology is key to the sustainable development of autonomous and wearable electronic devices. This article highlights the application of various types of biomass in the production of CEs by using different types of pyrolysis and experimental conditions and denotes some possible effects on their final characteristics. An overview is provided on the use of different biomass types for the synthesis of CEs with efficient electrochemical properties for batteries and supercapacitors. This review showed that, from different biomass residues, it is possible to obtain CEs with different electrochemical properties and that they can be successfully applied in high-performance batteries and supercapacitors. As the research and development of producing CEs still faces a gap by linking the type and composition of biomass residues with the carbon electrodes\&rsquo; electrochemical performances in supercapacitor and battery applications, this work tries to diminish this gap. Physical and chemical characteristics of the CEs, such as porosity, chemical composition, and surface functionalities, are reflected in the electrochemical performances. It is expected that this review not only provides the reader with a good overview of using various biomass residues in the energy storage applications, but also highlights some goals and challenges remaining in the future research and development of this topic.},

  abstract = {The fleet of electric vehicles has increased worldwide, pushed by the necessity of building a low-carbon economy. In Brazil, the number of new electric cars registered per year is also increasing, especially after the promulgation of the Program Route 2030. Collection rates and management criteria for end-of-life lithium-ion batteries (EOL LIBs) in the country are still not defined. Therefore, in this paper, we aimed to assess how big the market of electric cars (EC) will be in Brazil in 2030 and to investigate how different management patterns can affect the flows of electrodes active materials in the country. Simulations were conducted using Matlab, considering three different scenarios of penetration of EC in the total fleet of cars in 2030: 1\%, 4\% and 10\%, while three management strategies were analyzed for the year of 2030 using Material Flow Analysis. According to the model, the number of new electric cars entering the Brazilian market in 2030 can surpass 1,800,000 units, resulting in a demand of Li, Co, Ni, Mn and graphite of up to 8,700, 15,000, 46,000, 15,000 and 92,000 tonnes, respectively. The number of EOL LIBs in the same year may overcome 340 thousand. The amount of material available for recycling depends on the management strategy adopted. In any case, revenues from recycling LIBs electrode active materials result mainly from Co and Ni recovery (88--93\%). In view of increasing circularity of materials and expected technological development, the adoption of repurposing and remanufacturing is recommended.},

At the same time, the resulting large number of LIB waste certainly poses safety hazards if it is not properly disposed of and will seriously harm the environment due to its inherent toxicity due to the use of toxic substances. Moreover, the consumption of many scarce precious metal resources is behind the mass production of batteries. In the light of severe environmental, resources, safety and recycling problems, recycling spent LIBs have become an essential urgently needed action to achieve sustainable social development. This review therefore critically analyses the value and the need for recycling of spent LIBs from a variety of resources and the environment. A range of existing technologies for recycling and reusing spent LIBs, such as pretreatment, pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and direct recycled methods, is subsequently summarized exclusively. In addition, the benefits and problems of the methods described above are analyzed in detail. It also introduces recycling progress of other LIB components, such as anodes, separators, and electrolytes, as well as the high-value cathode. Finally, the prospects for recycling LIBs are addressed in four ways (government, users, battery manufacturers, and recyclers). This review should contribute to the development of the recycling of used LIBs, particularly in support of industrialization and recycling processes.},

Molten salt carbonization and activation (MSCA) is a promising approach to converting biomass to functional biocarbon and reducing or neutralizing carbon impact on the environment. It uses a single thermal treatment and features high-efficiency conversion, rapid production, and low resource and processing costs. More importantly, in this process, the unmatched purely ionic environment at high temperatures can lead to in situ activation (pore generation) of the biocarbon and introduce desired ions into the carbon to enable unique functionalities. The biocarbon obtained possesses a fairly large specific surface area (SSA), balanced pore structure, and specific surface oxygen-containing groups for diverse applications. This review explains the fundamental and technological aspects of MSCA of biomass, focusing on the approaches, salt compositions (mixtures), processing conditions, and products. The properties of the obtained biocarbon are analyzed and compared in the context of practical applications. Areas for further investigation are also explored with the hope of this molten salt route becoming optimized and industrialized for a circular economy.},

The obtained rCB was then converted into activated carbon species through both chemical treatment and microwave coupled with chemical treatment as a two-step activation process. The activated carbon obtained from chemical activation was denoted as C-AC, while that obtained from exposure to microwave followed by chemical activation was labeled as MC-AC. These two structures were consequently introduced as sorbents for the removal of cadmium ions from an aqueous solution. The structural characteristics of the introduced adsorbents were confirmed using various techniques, namely X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Additionally, textual features of these adsorbents were acquired via both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and N2 adsorption--desorption BET surface area analyses. These two structures were then introduced for Cd ion adsorption under different operating conditions. Particularly, the effect of pH, contact time, adsorbent dose, and metal ion concentration on the efficiency of adsorption was investigated. The 1maximum adsorption capacity was detected at a pH value of 5.0, a contact time of 30 min, a sorbent dose of 0.4 g L-1, and an initial metal concentration of 50 mg L-1 using MC-AC, which exhibited nearly double the sorption capacity detected for C-AC. Kinetic studies indicated that the process of Cd(II) adsorption is perfectly described and fitted by the pseudo-second-order model. However, adsorption isotherms for the two adsorbents were found to match the Langmuir model, referring to the occurrence of uniform monolayer adsorption for the metal ions. Thermodynamic analysis demonstrated that the adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic.},

Introducing sulfur within a carbon framework is one of the most promising attempts toward the development of highly efficient anode materials. Herein, a microporous sulfur-rich carbon anode obtained from a liquid sulfur-containing oligomer is introduced. The sodium storage mechanism shifts from surface-controlled to diffusion-controlled at higher synthesis temperatures. The different storage mechanisms and electrode performances are found to be independent of the bare electrode material's interplanar spacing. Therefore, these differences are attributed to an increased microporosity and a thiophene-rich chemical environment. The combination of these properties enables extending the plateau region to higher potential and achieving reversible overpotential sodium storage. Moreover, in-operando small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reveals reversible electron density variations within the pore structure, in good agreement with the pore-filling sodium storage mechanism occurring in hard carbons (HCs). Eventually, the depicted framework will enable the design of high-performance anode materials for sodium-ion batteries with competitive energy density.},

However, these simple, single-step syntheses lack scalability due to the need of high temperatures and autogenous pressures to enable the dissolution of reagents and crystallization of the product. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time fast continuous synthesis of ceria nanoparticles at moderate conditions through the combination of the deep eutectic solvent reline (an eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea) as reaction medium and the high heat and mass transfer rate offered by microreactors. Almost 100\% yields are obtained within 100 s of residence time at 160 {$^\circ$}C, with some conversion achieved even at temperatures as low as 120 {$^\circ$}C. Such rapid synthesis takes place thanks to the molecular structure of the solvent which facilitates the fast nucleation of cerium oxycarbonate as an intermediate product. As expected in a kinetically controlled system, pressure and initial cerium concentration have negligible effects on the yield obtained. The rapid reaction, the cheap, benign, and environmentally friendly solvent, and the lack of additional additives in this work opens the door to sustainable large-scale continuous synthesis of ceria nanoparticles as well as other nanostructured materials.},

Presently, most hydrometallurgical recovery methods and some cathode material synthesis methods are based on the use of acidic solutions. This study addresses the dissolution-chelation mechanism and limitations of the LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 cathode materials in acidic solution, aiming at highlighting the interface reaction mechanism. In this work, malonic acid and hydrogen peroxide were used as the leaching system to conduct efficient green leaching of spent ternary cathode materials. The effects of different reaction parameters on the recovery efficiency of various valuable metal ions were studied by orthogonal and single-factor condition experiments. The results show that under the optimal conditions the leaching efficiency of the lithium ion is 95\%, and the leaching efficiencies of Ni, Co, and Mn all reached over 98\%. The dissolution mechanism was studied at the macro- and microscales based on the material characterization technology, kinetic studies, and the theoretical calculations of the binding energy of the possible product. Kinetic studies found that the dissolution-chelation process is controlled by chemical reactions or a chemical and diffusion reaction, and calculation results of the activation energy and binding energy show that lithium ions are leached preferentially over other metal ions. In addition, this recovery technology can be effectively used to recycle other spent rechargeable battery materials and may also lay a theoretical foundation for further study on the regeneration and resynthesis of materials.},

The present carbons have micropore volumes varying between 0.29 and 0.66 cm3 g-1 and average pore widths Lo between 0.62 and 1.23 nm. Five samples are exclusively microporous, whereas seven also display a relatively important mesoporosity. This allows a direct comparison between pairs of carbons with similar micropore systems, with and without mesopores, in order to assess the role of mesoporosity in the electrochemical properties. It appears that mesopores have only a limited influence on the decrease in capacitance at high current density as opposed to earlier assumptions. \copyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

  abstract = {Nanoporous polymers are becoming increasingly interesting materials for electrochemical applications, as their large surface areas with redox-active sites allow efficient adsorption and diffusion of ions. However, their limited electrical conductivity remains a major obstacle in practical applications. The conventional approach that alleviates this problem is the hybridisation of the polymer with carbon-based additives, but this directly prevents the utilisation of the maximum capacity of the polymers. Here, we report a layer-by-layer fabrication technique where we separated the active (porous polymer, top) layer and the conductive (carbon, bottom) layer and used these ``layered'' electrodes in a supercapacitor (SC). Through this approach, direct contact with the electrolyte and polymer material is greatly enhanced. With extensive electrochemical characterisation techniques, we show that the layered electrodes allowed a significant contribution of fast faradic surface reactions to the overall capacitance. The electrochemical performance of the layered-electrode SC outperformed other reported porous polymer-based devices with a specific gravimetric capacitance of 388 F{$\cdot$}g-1 and an outstanding energy density of 65 Wh{$\cdot$}kg-1 at a current density of 0.4 A{$\cdot$}g-1 . The device also showed outstanding cyclability with 90\% of capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 1.6 A{$\cdot$}g-1, comparable to the reported porous polymer-based SCs. Thus, the introduction of a layered electrode structure would pave the way for more effective utilisation of porous organic polymers in future energy storage/harvesting and sensing devices by exploiting their nanoporous architecture and limiting the negative effects of the carbon/binder matrix.},

Results reported that the environmental impacts are pervasive worldwide: marine litter, air, soil and water contamination, and the direct interaction of waste pickers with hazardous waste are the most important issues. Many reviews were published in the scientific literature about specific waste streams, in order to quantify its effect on the environment. This narrative literature review assessed global issues due to different waste fractions showing how several sources of pollution are affecting the environment, population health, and sustainable development. The results and case studies presented can be of reference for scholars and stakeholders for quantifying the comprehensive impacts and for planning integrated solid waste collection and treatment systems, for improving sustainability at a global level.},

  abstract = {The performance of symmetric supercapacitors with activated carbon electrodes, obtained from cellulose acetate microspheres as a precursor, has been studied using neutral aqueous sodium sulphate solutions as electrolytes. Although water-based electrolytes can safely operate in a broad temperature range, studies of supercapacitors beyond conventional room temperature conditions are rather limited, while most of investigations are focused on ionic liquids as electrolytes. However, since water represents a cheap, easy to handle and environmentally friendly solvent, detailed temperature investigations of supercapacitors with aqueous electrolytes are of importance. In the present work, we evaluated the behaviour of supercapacitors with electrolytes having various Na2SO4 concentrations, in a temperature range between 0 {$^\circ$}C and 60 {$^\circ$}C. Since stable and safe operation of supercapacitors with carbon electrodes exclusively depends on the electrolyte properties at these non-ambient conditions, the electrolytes were characterized with regard to their conductivity and viscosity at various temperatures. Activated carbon materials were produced by a one-step carbonization procedure of home-made cellulose acetate microspheres (CAM) using KOH as an activator, which was added to cellulose acetate microspheres in form of a solution for better homogenization. Supercapacitors with a neutral 1 M Na2SO4 solution as the best electrolyte composition were tested between 0 {$^\circ$}C and 60 {$^\circ$}C and provided specific capacitances between 91 F g-1 and 117 F g-1, demonstrating a good cycling stability with a retention of at least 95 \% of the initial capacitance over 2000 cycles. Energy densities of 16.6 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 16 kW kg-1 are provided at 25 {$^\circ$}C, whereas the energy density is improved at 60 {$^\circ$}C to 21.5 Wh kg-1 at a slightly lower power density of 13.7 kW kg-1. No sign of electrochemical corrosion of battery housings was observed after cycling, in contrast to acid-based electrolytes with H2SO4 tested for comparison.},

The low toxicity, high biodegradability, and straightforward preparation without further purification steps of naturally occurring low-cost compounds are among the key advantages. Although research on hydrophobic DESs is scarce (the first report was only published in 2015), some interesting features and applications have been reported and deserve to be evaluated and comparisons established. This Minireview is divided into two parts: The first part provides a brief general introduction to DESs and the second part discusses the nomenclature using solid--liquid phase diagram analysis, chemical stability, thermophysical properties comparison, and finally the most important emerging fields of application.},

  abstract = {The most commonly used electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors are activated carbons, because they are commercially available and cheap, and they can be produced with large specific surface area. However, only the electrochemically available surface area is useful for charging the electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL formation is especially efficient in carbon pores of size below 1 nm because of the lack of space charge and a good attraction of ions along the pore walls. The pore size should ideally match the size of the ions. However, for good dynamic charge propagation, some small mesopores are useful. An asymmetric configuration, where the positive and negative electrodes are constructed from different materials, e.g., activated carbon, transition metal oxide or conducting polymer, is of great interest because of an important extension of the operating voltage. In such a case, the energy as well as power is greatly increased. It appears that nanotubes are a perfect conducting additive and/or support for materials with pseudocapacitance properties, e.g. MnO2, conducting polymers. Substitutional heteroatoms in the carbon network (nitrogen, oxygen) are a promising way to enhance the capacitance. Carbons obtained by one-step pyrolysis of organic precursors rich in heteroatoms (nitrogen and/or oxygen) are very interesting, because they are denser than activated carbons. The application of a novel type of electrolyte with a broad voltage window (ionic liquids) is considered, but the stability of this new generation of electrolyte during long term cycling of capacitors is not yet confirmed.},

  abstract = {The growing demand for high-energy lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has promoted the production of LiNixCoyMnZO2 cathode, which results in many spent LIBs to resolve. A novel method that employs microwave carbothermic reduction was used to enhance the leaching of metals from layered LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 of spent LIBs. The thermodynamic analysis showed that LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 could be theoretically reduced to single metals in the presence of graphite. Then experimental results demonstrated that the transition metals can be effectively reduced under the parameters of 500 W microwave energy and 30min time. Afterward, multiscale characterizations revealed that microwave irradiation leads to the disorderly crystal structure and lattice cracks of LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 materials, which is more efficient to facilitate their interparticle liberation and destruction of crystal structure compared with the conventional heating process. Based on the characterization of the reduction products and their leaching performance, the mechanism for microwave carbothermic reduction was accordingly raised. Finally, the leaching experimental results show the optimal efficiencies of 97\% transition metals (Co Ni, and Mn) and 99\% Li were obtained under microwave carbothermic reduction, which is found more efficient in comparison to the samples without microwave treated. The whole process is found to be effective and sustainable for recovery of valuable metals from the industrial electrode of spent LIBs.},

It was proved that the CO 2 , CO, and H 2 gases are released as a result of electrolyte decomposition. And it shows that the CO and H 2 gases evolution is a direct consequence of the electrochemical reaction of electrolyte decomposition, while the CO 2 generation is a consequence of the additional chemical reaction of interaction between the O 2 released from the cathode atomic lattice oxygen and CO released from the same place on the cathode (appearing because of the electrolyte decomposition). That is why at the same electrochemical reaction of electrolyte decomposition, the ratio CO 2 /CO varies in the wide range from 0.82 to 2.42 depending on cycling conditions (temperature and cutoff voltage). It was proved that a potential-independent H 2 evolution is a consequence of its adsorption in pores of powdered graphite on anode. There was proposed the mechanism of the electrolyte decomposition and the gases evolution in lithium-ion cells at their cycling, which corresponds quantitatively to all obtained experimental results. Now the lithium-ion batteries get more and more widespread use. First of all, this is connected with their high specific capacity and energy as well as their long enough service life. 1-3 Now the lithium-ion batteries prevail in the segment of batteries of small-format. They are used in smartphones, notebooks, hover boards, etc. Recently, more pervasive use is typical for lithium-ion batteries of large-format in connection with their application in electric vehicles and airplanes. 4 The elec-trochemical processes in these batteries running during their charge \& discharge have been studied quite well. 5 However, for lithium-ion batteries, processes of aging and gases evolution during their cycling are studied insufficiently. 6 For energy density increase, a high voltage is necessary of the cathode material. 7-9 At present time, a number of potentially promising cathode materials exists. 7 One of such promising materials is the lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LiNi x Mn y Co z O 2 , NMC). For these batteries capacity and energy density increase, it is necessary to use the high cutoff voltage. 10-12 The high cutoff voltage increases lithium efficiency rate. 12,13 However at the same time, the high cutoff voltage results in a considerable gases evolution growth and a cells' coulombic efficiency decrease. 14-19 That is why now for batteries of the kind, the cutoff voltage is used around 4.3V. Nevertheless, even under this cutoff voltage on both cathode and anode, gases are released. 20,21 In general, the gases evolution in the lithium-ion batteries is a serious problem; it is especially so in the case of their work under high voltages and temperatures. 22,23 In the paper 20 in order to find out, what kind of gases are released on cathodes and anodes at cycling of lithium-ion batteries, a two-chamber cell was used, in which its cathode and anode were separated by Li+-ion conducting glass. The released gases were analyzed with aid of OEMS (on-line elec-trochemical mass spectrometry). The experimental studies showed that at cycling of lithium-ion batteries on their cathodes, the gases CO 2 and CO are released, while on their anodes the gases C 2 H 4 , CO and H 2 do. The majority of researchers believe that the hydrogen is released due to reduction of residual moisture on an anode in line with the formula H 2 O + e - {$\rightarrow$} OH - + 1/2 H 2. The residual moisture can appear as a result of electrolyte contamination by water or incorrect drying of electrodes and other battery components. However the experimental studies 20,21 showed that the released hydrogen amount is much bigger than its content in a residual moisture. Hence, the hydrogen is released also due to the electrochemical decomposition of}

Developing an effective method to recover Co from spent LIBs is of great economic significance. In the present study, we designed an efficient sulfuric acid-vitamin C system for the extraction of Co from spent LIBs and determined the effects of operational parameters on the extraction of Co. The results showed that there were optimum values for the concentration of sulfuric acid and leaching temperature in promoting leaching. For vitamin C, its effectiveness increased with concentration to a maximal value, but raising the concentration further was without significant effect. The leaching time hardly affected the extraction of Co. Although changes in solid--liquid ratios at low value did not greatly influence recovery, high ratios significantly decreased it. The final optimized experimental scheme was derived from a simulation using the Design-Expert 8.0.6.1 software. Optimal reaction conditions, under which 95.5\% of Co was recovered, contained 3 mol{$\cdot$}L -1 sulfuric acid and 0.56 mol{$\cdot$}L -1 vitamin C with S/L ratio at 15 g{$\cdot$}L -1 and leaching temperature of 70 {$^\circ$}C.

The characteristics of pyrolytic carbon black can be enhanced through chemical activation in order to produce the required properties for its application. In the search to make the waste tire pyrolysis process profitable, new applications of the pyrolytic solid products have been explored, such as for the fabrication of energy-storage devices and precursor in the synthesis of nanomaterials. In this study, waste tires powder was chemically activated using acid (H2SO4) and/or alkali (KOH) to recover pyrolytic carbon black with different characteristics. H2SO4 removed surface impurities more thoroughly, improving the carbon black's surface area, while KOH increased its oxygen content, which improved the carbon black's stability in water suspension. Pyrolytic carbon black was fully characterized by elemental analysis, inductively coupled plasma--optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption/desorption, scanning electron microscopy--energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and {$\zeta$} potential measurement. In addition, the pyrolytic carbon black was used to explore its feasibility as a precursor for the synthesis of carbon dots; synthesized carbon dots were analyzed preliminarily by SEM and with a fluorescence microplate reader, revealing differences in their morphology and fluorescence intensity. The results presented in this study demonstrate the effect of the activating agent on pyrolytic carbon black from waste tires and provide evidence of the feasibility of using waste tires for the synthesis of nanomaterials such as carbon dots.},

The activated carbons (ACs) used in this study were produced from chemically modified lignite, subbituminous and bituminous coals by carbonization and subsequent activation with steam. The BET surface area of ACs studied ranged from 340 to 1270m2g-1. The performance of ACs as EDLC electrodes was characterized using voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and impedance spectroscopy measurements. For the carbons with surface area up to 1000m2g-1, the higher BET surface area the higher specific capacitance (Fg-1) for both electrolytes. The surface capacitance ({$\mu$}Fcm-2) increases also with the mesopore content. The optimum range of mesopore content in terms of the use of ACs studied for EDLCs was found to be between 20 and 50\%. A maximum capacitance exceeding 160Fg-1 and a relatively high surface capacitance about 16{$\mu$}Fcm-2 measured in H2SO4 solution were achieved for the AC prepared from a sulfonated subbituminous coal. This study shows that the ACs produced from coals exhibit a better performance as an electrode material of EDLC in H2SO4 than in KOH electrolytic solutions. For KOH, the capacitance per unit mesopore surface is slightly lower than that referred to unit micropore surface (9.1 versus 10.1{$\mu$}Fcm-2). However, in the case of H2SO4 the former capacitance is double and even higher compared with the latter (23.1 versus 9.8{$\mu$}Fcm-2). On the other hand, the capacitance per micropore surface area is the same in both electrolytes used, about 10.0{$\mu$}Fcm-2.},

The interplay between electrochemical response, stability, material type, object complexity and end use application are key to realising 3D printing for electrochemical energy storage.

  abstract = {Fast charging/discharging rate and long life span render supercapacitors a potential candidate for the next generation energy supply. Nevertheless, the remaining wide gap between the basic/experimental research and practical requirements acts as the main barrier for further progress. In consequence, devising new techniques and platforms to well match the key and urgent requirements from a commercial/usable standpoint is highly desired. Specifically, although great progress has been made for the configuration of tailor-made electrode materials in terms of methodology and mechanisms, to meet the practical requirement, a bottleneck and urgent issue is to keep a decent performance when increasing the mass loading multi-times to the commercial level. Frustratingly, due to the greatly inhibited and worsened charge storage and ion migration dynamics, it is so challenging to reach this goal and it has confused researchers to a great extent up to now. In this review, we try to illustrate and clarify the involved fundamental principles for commercial-level mass-loading electrodes, including the analysis and evaluation of ion permeation/diffusion, charge transfer and redox reaction dynamics. Subsequently, we summarize and comment on the up-to-date key achievements and progress toward commercial-level mass-loading electrodes, which is divided into six branches: coupling with 3D conductive substrates, creating available pore channels, configuring hierarchical structures, aligning internal constructions by physical force/field, optimizing the properties by hetero-atoms/ions and engineering conductive MOFs. In parallel, some scientific perceptions and impressive concepts to facilitate the reaction dynamics are also highlighted. Moreover, concise outlooks/perspectives are presented here with an expectation to spark new ideas and endeavors for bringing supercapacitors into practical and daily-life applications.}

This is highlighted by the research that shows how DBR has become a mainstay, ubiquitous feature of graduate programmes in the Learning Sciences internationally (Sommerhoff et al, 2018). The Learning Sciences is a field of academic enquiry concerned with advancing our understanding of how we can innovate systematically to improve educational experiences and systems; and invariably where we are trying to exploit the novel, interactive affordances and capabilities offered by new digital technology. The increased use of design as a systematic research methodology around the world highlights its continued, and growing relevance and importance. The increasing popularity of educational design research methodologies, including DBR, owes to their potential to be both practically focused but theoretically robust. DBR, as a participatory and principled research methodology, can potentially support educational designers, innovators, policymakers and technologists to bridge practice and theory. Starting with an outline of the provenance and history of DBR methodology, this paper describes educational design research methodologies, illustrating how DBR can be employed to enhance the development of digital technologies in education.}

Complex hydrogen bonding is postulated as the root cause of their melting point depressions and physicochemical properties; to understand these hydrogen bonded networks, it is imperative to study these systems as dynamic entities using both simulations and experiments. This review emphasizes recent research efforts in order to elucidate the next steps needed to develop a fundamental framework needed for a deeper understanding of DESs.

In the following we will introduce key pieces of European legislation affecting nanomaterials, analyze their limitations, and provide a number of recommendations on how these can be overcome. We find that, although nanomaterials are in principle covered by the scope of many of the existing legislative frameworks, it is often unclear, if current regulations are actually applicable when it comes to specific nanomaterials and their diverse applications. Main limitations seem to be: that requirements to do safety evaluations are triggered by production volumes by tonnage not tailored to the nanoscale, the profound lack of (eco)toxicological data, and that thresholds values and occupational exposure limits cannot be established with existing methodologies.},

A NADES composed of betaine (Bet) as a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and levulinic acid (LevA) as a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) was investigated for its extraction capacity of thiophene, pyridine, and toluene from n-decane via liquid-liquid extraction. First, the HBA/HBD molar ratio was optimized based on the highest overall extraction efficiency, which was achieved for Bet/LevA (1:7). Furthermore, the selected NADES was characterized by measuring its density, dynamic viscosity, and water content. Then, the solubility of each fuel impurity in the NADES was measured. Moreover, the liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) data of the pseudo-ternary systems \textbraceleft n-decane (1) + thiophene/pyridine/toluene (2) + Bet/LevA (1:7) (3)\textbraceright{} were determined at 298.15 K and 1.01 bar. The assumption of a pseudo-ternary system, which means that the NADES stays intact in one phase, was validated experimentally. The solute distribution ratios, selectivities, and the extraction efficiencies of each impurity at a 1:1 solvent-to-feed mass ratio were calculated from the experimental LLE data and compared to a benchmark solvent (i.e. sulfolane) and other ionic liquids and DESs reported in the literature. The LLE data were also correlated using the nonrandom two-liquid thermodynamic model. The regressed LLE data showed good agreement with the experimental data as the root-mean-square deviation was found to be {$\leq$}0.29\%. Finally, it is clear that Bet/LevA (1:7) can be considered as a potential natural solvent for combined desulfurization, denitrification, and dearomatization processes.}

Findings: The results of the study indicate that the provision of soft skills training plays a crucial role in improving the overall business performance of female entrepreneurs in rural areas. This study explores how soft skills trainings improved their daily life activities and smoothed also business activities.This study underscores the positive impact of soft skills training, encompassing improved communication, leadership, problem-solving, decision-making, and self-motivation, on rural women's development and entrepreneurship in Bangladesh. Practical Implications: It is imperative for policy makers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sectorsto prioritize the integration of soft skills trainings into programs designed to promote the economic progress of rural women in Bangladesh for mitigating the hiatus between their existing skill sets and the requirements of their businesses inclusion. Originality/Value: Existing literature on soft skills training for rural women is deficient in gender-specific analysis and regional/cultural variation examination, which impedes the development of individualized programs. This study addresses the gender and regional specificities of Bangladesh while examining the efficacy of soft skills trainings for rural women through the use of a mixed methods approach.

Therefore, it is necessary to identify and expand applications of CBp. This work focuses on the preparation of activated carbon (AC) from CBp using the physicochemical activation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and potassium hydroxide (KOH). Thereafter, AC is applied to the electrode of the electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC). The AC prepared by CO2/KOH activation exhibited a hierarchical pore structure. The specific surface area increased from 415 to 733 m2 g-1, and in combination with low ash content of 1.51\%, ensured abundant ion diffusion channels and active sites to store charge. The EDLC comprising the AC (AC-2) electrode prepared by excitation of CO2 (300 sccm) and KOH had a reasonable gravimetric specific capacitance of 192 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, and exhibited a good rate capability of 73\% at 50 A g-1 in a three-electrode system. Moreover, the EDLC device comprising the AC-2 electrode delivered excellent cycling stability (capacitance retention of 106\% after 10000 cycles at 2 A g-1 in a two-electrode system). Furthermore, a symmetric supercapacitor based on an AC electrode that exhibits a supreme energy density of 4.7 Wh kg-1 and a maximum power density of 6362.6 W kg-1 is demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Deep eutectic solvent (DES) is becoming an important alternative for green and high efficient recycling of spent lithium ion batteries (LIBs). In this study, we proposed a simple and universal approach by applying ionization potential (IP) calculation assisted with cyclic voltammetry test to assist selection of organic acid as efficient reductant in the DES for battery recycling. The reducibility of organic acid was found to have a close relationship with the IP, with organic acids of lower IP being a more preferred reductant. Based on this approach, the hydrous choline chloride-L-ascorbic acid DES was identified and verified to be efficient for metals leaching from LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode in multiple cycles, exhibiting leaching efficiencies over 96\% for Li, Mn, Co and Ni under a mild leaching condition (50\textcelsius, 1 h). The IP calculation is effective for screening reductive acids, and is also feasible for predicting reaction mechanism. Metals were effectively recovered through sequential precipitation. The deep eutectic solvent designed from IP calculation is versatile for treating various kinds of spent battery cathodes and recyclable for multiple uses, decreasing the production of secondary chemical waste and pollution.},

  abstract = {Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have attracted extensive research for their potential applications as leaching solvent to recycle valuable metal elements from spent lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Despite various advantages like being economical and green, the full potential of conventional binary DES has not yet been harnessed because of the kinetics during leaching. Herein, we consider the fundamental rate-determining-step (RDS) in conventional binary DES and attempt to design ternary DES, within which the chemical reaction kinetics and diffusion kinetics can be regulated to maximize the overall leaching rate. As a proof of concept, we show that the ternary choline chloride/succinic acid/ethylene glycol (ChCl/SA/EG) type ternary DES can completely dissolve LCO powder at 140 {$^\circ$}C in 16 h. By systematically studying the leaching process at various conditions, the energy barrier during leaching can be calculated to be 11.77 kJ/mol. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the extraction of the cobalt ions from the leaching solution can be directly achieved by adding oxalic ions without neutralizing the solution. The precipitate can be used to regenerate LCO with high purity. The recycled materials show comparable electrochemical performance with commercial LCO. Our design strategy of ternary DES with regulated RDS is expected to have both scientific and technological significance in the field of hydrometallurgical recycling of LIBs.}

  abstract = {The disposal of spent lithium-ion power batteries (LIBs) has become an important research topic owing to the booming market for electric vehicles. However, the recovery efficiency of the alkaline solution and organic solvent methods currently used to separate Al foil from cathode materials still has room for improvement. The insufficient separation of Al foil and complexity of the battery types present obstacles to the extraction of valuable metals using simple processes. In this study, an efficient approach is developed to separate the Al foil in mixed-type spent LIBs (M-LIBs), namely, LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM), LiFePO4 (LFP), and LiMn2O4 (LMO) LIBs, by controlled pyrolysis. Hundred percent of the Al foil was recovered at the temperature of 450 {$^\circ$}C, holding time of 60 min, and heating rate of 10 {$^\circ$}C/min. The purity of Al in the recovered foil was 99.41 \%, 99.83 \% and 99.92 \%, and the recovery efficiency of the active cathode materials was 96.01 \%, 99.80 \% and 99.15 \% for NCM, LFP and LMO, respectively, without the loss of active cathode materials. The obtained active cathode materials exhibited a favorable crystalline structure, and the average particle diameter was reduced from 300.497 to 24.316 {$\mu$}m with a smaller and looser morphology. The process could be well fitted with the Friedman differential equation, and the correlation coefficients were higher than 0.99. The efficient separation could be attributed to the complete rupture of long chain --(CH2CF2)--n bonds in the poly (vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) binder, which resulted in the formation of HF, trifluorobenzene, alkanes, and gaseous single molecule CH2[dbnd]CF2. Therefore, this work potentially provides an alternative approach for the efficient separation of Al foil in M-LIBs, thereby simplifying the process and achieving lower cost, reduced loss of valuable metals, and higher recovery efficiency.},

In this study, polyaniline (PANI) films have been prepared in deep eutectic solvent (Oxaline, a eutectic mixture of oxalic acid and choline chloride) and acidic aqueous media using cyclic voltammetry associated with the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). PANI was found to grow in both liquids although the rate of growth was slower in Oxaline than aqueous acid due to the higher viscosity of the former. The results showed that PANI electrodes made in aqueous solutions grow by an autocatalytic mechanism, unlike those in deep eutectic solvents (DESs). The stability and durability of some films was examined in DESs and aqueous solutions at 25\,{$^\circ$}C and 50\,{$^\circ$}C. The results showed the mobile species are different when cycled in the DES compared to aqueous media. For films grown in different media but cycled in aqueous acid, the anion (HSO4-) was found to dominate the mobile species. However, the mass behaviour of PANI electrodes (deposited from aqueous/Oxaline-DES) in DESs (Ethaline) at 50\,{$^\circ$}C was most strongly associated with cation (Ch+) egress (i.e., mass decrease) during the oxidation reaction and cation (Ch+) ingress (i.e., mass increase) during the reduction reaction. In addition, the results showed that temperature plays an important role in increasing the rate of diffusion and the stability of mass change in viscous ionic liquids.},

If theoretical modeling of ionic crystals is relatively easy to achieve from X-ray diffraction data in view of the periodic arrangements of ions in the structure, it becomes a much more involved process when molten salts are considered because of interparticle interactions due to collisions. A single experimental technique usually gives a partial picture of the situation only so that a multiple-technique approach has to be used combining for instance X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy, density measurements, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo calculations. The review first focuses on the definition of the radial distribution function and on the ways to estimate coordination numbers in the first and second shell from this function. It then describes the present knowledge for melts of rare-earth and alkali halides and further on concentrates on salts with polyatomic anions. The penetration of ions from the second into the first coordination sphere is discussed as well as the formation of polymeric ions and their clustering.

  abstract = {E nergy storage systems (ESSs) offer a practical solution to store energy harnessed from renewable energy sources and provide a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels for power generation by releasing it when required, as electricity. The energy stored and later supplied by ESSs can greatly benefit the energy industry during regular operation and more so during power outages. Electrochemical energy storage has taken a big leap in adoption compared to other ESSs such as mechanical (e.g., flywheel), electrical (e.g., supercapacitor, superconducting magnetic storage), thermal (e.g., latent phase change material), and chemical (e.g., fuel cells) types, thanks to the success of rechargeable batteries. Figure 1 depicts the various components that go into building a battery energy storage system (BESS) that can be a stand-alone ESS or can also use harvested energy from renewable energy sources for charging. The electrochemical cell is the fundamental component in creating a BESS. A module is a set of single cells connected in parallel-series configurations to provide the required battery capacity and voltage. The complete set of modules arranged in racks constitutes a battery. A battery management system (BMS) allows for monitoring and controlling the charge and discharge of the battery. Thermal management of the battery is managed by the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system that controls the environmental temperature and humidity. Integrating the BESS with renewable energy sources for the charging process can be done directly or through an AC/DC inverter. The BESS battery operates with DC, and renewable energy sources can produce both AC and/or DC current. The DC/AC inverter also enables the BESS to be integrated with the electrical grid by demanding energy when needed or supplying excess energy, as long as the minimum requirements of the grid are met. Battery technologies currently utilized in grid-scale ESSs are lithium-ion (Li-ion), lead-acid, nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH), nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd), sodium-sulfur (Na-S), sodium-nickel chloride (Na-NiCl 2), and flow batteries. 1-3 Recently, some demonstration zinc-air systems have also been announced. 1,4 The main characteristics of these battery types are listed in Table 1. According to the data collected by the United States Department of Energy (DOE), in the past 20 years, the most popular battery technologies in terms of installed or planned capacity in grid applications are flow batteries, sodium-based batteries, and Li-ion batteries, accounting for more than 80\% of the battery energy storage capacity. 1 Li-ion batteries have become popular in new grid-level installations due to their rapidly decreasing prices and wide availability in the market. Large ESSs are manufactured with a variety of Li-ion chemistries, from those with a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode to those with a nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) cathode and with graphite, silicon composite, or lithium titanate (LTO) anodes. 1,6 Moreover, the second-life use of aged Li-ion batteries from electric vehicles in less demanding stationary applications has become a feasible concept to extend the useful life of those batteries. However, the economic viability of Li-ion battery reuse needs to be solved, and challenges regarding the safety of aged batteries, state-of-health determination, and compatibility issues need to be overcome. 6,7 Other battery technologies, such as lithium-sulfur, sodium-ion, and magnesium-ion types, are suitable for future use in grid applications due to their high energy density. However, these systems are still in the developmental stage and currently suffer from poor cycle life, preventing their use in grid energy storage applications. Flow batteries store energy in electrolyte solutions which contain two redox couples pumped through the battery cell stack. Many different redox couples can be used, such as V/V, V/Br 2 , Zn/Br 2 , S/Br 2 , Ce/Zn, Fe/Cr, and Pb/Pb, which affect the performance metrics of the batteries. 1,3 The vanadium and Zn/Br 2 redox flow batteries are the most commonly used and are already mature for grid-level applications. The advantages of flow batteries include lower cost, high cycle life, design flexibility, and tolerance to deep discharges. Additionally, high heat capacity is also effective in limiting high temperature rises in flow battery systems, making them safer systems compared to other rechargeable battery systems. The nature of the various compounds generated in flow batteries of various chemistries during charge and discharge has been characterized , but their behavior under off-nominal conditions, such as overcharge , over-discharge, and external short circuits, has not been characterized. System-level studies at large scale will shed light on the susceptibility of flow batteries to undergo}

The experiments were carried out to optimize the process parameters for the recovery of lithium and cobalt by varying the concentration of leachant, pulp density, reductant volume and temperature. Leaching with 2M sulfuric acid with the addition of 5\% H2O2 (v/v) at a pulp density of 100g/L and 75{$^\circ$}C resulted in the recovery of 99.1\% lithium and 70.0\% cobalt in 60min.

Leaching kinetics of lithium in sulfuric acid fitted well to the chemical controlled reaction model i.e. 1-(1-X)1/3=kct. Leaching kinetics of cobalt fitted well to the model 'ash diffusion control dense constant sizes spherical particles' i.e. 1-3(1-X)2/3+2(1-X)=kct. Metals could subsequently be separated selectively from the leach liquor by solvent extraction process to produce their salts by crystallization process from the purified solution. \copyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The process of thermal runaway (TR) of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is often accompanied by a large amount of heat generation and gas release. However, the gas release behavior during the process of TR remains unclear. Three types of 26700 LIBs with LiFePO4 (LFP), LiMn2O4 (LMO) and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) as cathodes are triggered to TR, respectively. Subsequently, the gas releases behavior of fully charged batteries during the TR process is obtained. Before the battery temperature approaches the uncontrollable temperature, the electrolyte volatilization and gas releasing are decoupled, the gas release of LFP, LMO and NCM batteries are 0.094 mol, 0.042 mol and 0.058 mol, respectively. These gases account for 29.1, 75.2 and 55.4\% of the gas volume that cause the safety valve to open in the LFP, LMO, NCM batteries, respectively. After battery temperature approaches the uncontrollable temperature, the reasons for the rapid increase in total pressure are qualitatively analyzed by investigating the structural changes of the cathode materials before and after TR. For the LFP battery, the gas release is found to be the main cause of the structural change, and for the LMO and NCM batteries, the impact force is the dominant cause.},

Moreover, overcharging is an important reason for thermal runaway. In order to prevent the occurrence of overcharge thermal runaway (OTR) events, a new three-level warning method is presented. By comparing Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) and thermo-couple real-time thermal monitoring, FBG shows a better temperature response. The OTR experiment is carried out, and the whole process of lithium battery thermal runaway under different overcharge rates (1 C, 1.5 C, and 2 C) is divided into three stages. Based on the cross-sensitivity of strain and temperature for FBG, a composite parameter (virtual temperature) affected by temperature and strain is proposed as an early warning index. Combining with the changes in virtual temperature, surface temperature, and the early voltage variation of thermal runaway, a three-level early warning model for thermal runaway is proposed. The first-level warning: the temperature difference between virtual temperature and surface temperature reaches 5 {$\bullet$} C. The second-level warning: the virtual temperature reaches 70 {$\bullet$} C. The third-level warning: the surface temperature reaches 80 {$\bullet$} C. This method can provide a reference for monitoring and early warning of LIBs in energy storage power stations.}

In this study, the production behavior, characters, and mechanism of carbon black from pyrolysis of natural rubber (NR), butadiene rubber (BR), and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) were investigated. The yield of carbon black was increased from 20.8\%--24.4\% to 47.9\%--56.7\% with the increase of pyrolysis temperature from 1100 to 1300{$^\circ$}C. Although the carbon black production yield from NR was lower than that of BR and SBR at 1300{$^\circ$}C, the graphitization degree (ID/IG = 2.22), microcrystal length (3.17 nm) and mean particle diameter (90.3 nm) of the carbon black derived from NR were the highest. The volatile evolution, carbon black nucleation mechanisms were revealed by reactive force-field molecular dynamics simulations. The pyrolysis of BR and SBR generated more C2H2, C2H3{$\cdot$}, long carbon-chains and cyclic molecules than NR, which probably resulted in a higher carbon black yield than NR. With few defect borders, regular stacking and wrapping of the aromatic layers, the carbon black from NR exhibited more ordered nucleation and high graphitization degree.},

Herein, CBp is proposed as a carbon precursor to prepare porous carbon for electrode materials via acid-base combined treatment and KOH activation process. The obtained activated CBp (A-CBp) has a higher degree of disorder, hierarchical pore structure and enhanced specific surface area, possessing a large quantity of electrolyte storage space, ions migration channels and active sites.

In addition, the assembled symmetrical supercapacitor exhibits a superb energy density of 22.6 Wh kg-1 in 1 M Et4NBF4/AN organic electrolyte for practical application.

However, critical issues, such as tedious procedures and improper disposal of hazardous wastes, need to be solved urgently and efficiently. Generally, the recovery of lithium is emphasized during the recycling process, yet the relatively low valuable Fe/P compounds are rarely concerned, which are considered as hazardous materials. Herein, a simplified and economical method is developed to treat spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) by utilizing LiFePO4 cathode scraps as the raw precursors to fabricate novel anode material Fe2P2O7. Specifically, thermodynamic analysis confirms the feasibility of the selective extraction of lithium and synchronous separation of Li/Fe/Al elements. Under the optimal experimental parameters, the leaching efficiency of lithium can reach up to 98.84\% and that of Fe/Al is below 1\%, demonstrating the superior selectivity of lithium. Significantly, the waste leaching slag FePO4 is flexibly utilized to regenerate Fe2P2O7, which is applied as a novel anode material for LIBs and exhibits satisfactory rate capability and competitive long-term cycling stability (reversible capacities of 147.2 mAh g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 after 500 cycles with an excellent retention of 88.55\%). This presented strategy takes full advantages of spent batteries by recycling the valuable fragments and turning solid waste into value-added anode materials simultaneously. It is convinced that the potential ``waste to treasure'' approach provides an environmental-friendly technology to reutilize the spent LIBs, which achieves the interdisciplinary of resource recycling and energy storage area.},

The experimental results show that the molar ratio of DES plays a decisive role in the solvent structure and supercapacitor performance. When the molar ratio of ChCl, EG and H2O is 1:2:2, the DES structure is the most stable, the total energy is the largest (49.93 eV), also exhibiting the high voltage window of 2.4 V, and the wide temperature range of - 40 to 80 {$^\circ$}C.

As the demand increases, the quantity of discarded lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has been continuously rising, bringing a tough waste-management challenge for recycling service sectors at end-of-life. Nevertheless, spent LIBs also bring an opportunity because of their double-edged competitive advantages in ecology and economy. This comprehensive review is initiated on the background of the skyrocketing global lithium ion battery market, covering the possible environmental hazard and huge economic potential, with emphasis placed on state-of-the-art reclamation technologies.

Besides, effective reclamation strategies, based on pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy or both, are in full swing to maximize resource recovery. Here, we provide a systematic overview of spent LIB recycling technologies from an all-sided perspective in current status. Perspectives for developing technologies, establishing evaluation standards, and exploring correlative scientific issues are discussed.

Herein, a green and effective one-step hydrothermal approach was proposed for the direct regeneration of spent LFP. LFP will lose part of its lithium and convert into FePO4 (FP) during long-term cycles. Thus, a supplement of lost lithium is essential to regenerate spent LFP, and this is thermodynamically feasible to achieve under hydrothermal conditions. The hydrothermal conditions of temperature, Li+ concentration, and reductant dosage were investigated. It was found that enhancement of hydrothermal conditions was beneficial to supplementing lithium, correspondingly improving the electrochemical performance. Under the hydrothermal conditions of 200 {$^\circ$}C for 3 h, 12 g L-1 of Li+, L/S = 6 mL g-1, and 1.0 mL of reductant (for every 5 g of spent LFP), the regenerated LFP displayed excellent discharge capacities of 146.2 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, 141.9 mAh g-1 at 1 C, and 128.2 mAh g-1 at 5 C. Additionally, the capacity retention reached up to 98.6\% after 200 cycles at 1 C.

  abstract = {A one-step preparation method of phosphorus-doped graphene oxide electrode (P-GOE) was used as electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors. Phosphorus-doped graphene oxides were synthesized on pencil graphite electrodes in one step with easy, cheap, and non-toxic chemicals by using the chronoamperometric process. Electrochemical analyses were carried out to examine the capacitive behavior of the electrodes in different deep eutectic solvents (DESs) (choline chloride:ethylene glycol (ChCl:EG), choline chloride:urea (ChCl:U), choline chloride:phenol (ChCl:Ph)). The electrolytes used make research valuable because these electrolytes were environmentally friendly, non-toxic, and inexpensive. Electrodes were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry at different scan rates, charge-discharge test at different current densities, 1000-cycle galvanostatic charge-discharge test, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Structural and morphological properties of the electrodes were investigated by FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET, and XPS. As a result of the characterization and electrochemical analysis, it was seen that the phosphorus doping to the electrodes were carried out successfully. The maximum areal capacitances of phosphorus-doped graphene oxide electrodes were calculated to be 450 mF.cm-2, 140 mF.cm-2, and 400 mF.cm-2 in electrolytes for supercapacitor applications. In this study, high-performance P-doped graphene oxide electrodes were produced with an easy method using inexpensive and non-toxic solvents, providing an important contribution as environmentally friendly and sustainable electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.},

  abstract = {The effective disposal and/or utilization of polyethylene terephthalate ((C10H8O4)n, PET) waste plastics are currently global problems that need to be addressed urgently. The current research examines the molten salt-based thermal treatment of PET waste, as a new approach to tackle this challenge. The effect of various molten salts, comprising KCl, MgCl2, ZnCl2, NaCl, KF and NaF on the structural and morphological evolution of PET upon heating in air to 1300 {$^\circ$}C is investigated. PET is transformed into carbon materials with different characteristics, including graphene-like nanosheets and porous nanostructures, with different electrical conductivity values, depending on the type of salt employed. The melting and evaporation points, as well as the cation size of the salt, are found to have a significant influence on the morphology and the crystallization level of the carbon products, based on which the characteristics of PET-derived carbons are regulated. Accordingly, the crystallinity and graphitization degree of the carbon materials obtained in NaF, KF and NaCl are found to be considerably greater than those obtained in ZnCl2, MgCl2 and KCl. The possible mechanism involved in the conversion of PET into carbon nanostructures in the molten salt environment is discussed. The results obtained provide insights into molten salt conversion of PET into carbon materials with different properties for various applications.},

  abstract = {This study examines the preparation of graphitic carbon nanostructures, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with both cylindrical and bamboo-like morphology and spherical carbon nanoparticles by electrochemical erosion of graphite cathodes in molten LiCl on a scale of more than 10 g which could easily be increased to a larger scale. A uniform erosion of graphite electrodes was achieved using bare electrodes immersed in molten salt. It was demonstrated that any shadow on the graphite cathode made by ceramic insulators impedes erosion of the electrode. Moreover, the carbon products obtained at different cathode current densities ranging from about 0.4 to 1 A cm-2 were characterized by electron microscopy. Accordingly, a mechanism is proposed for the erosion of the graphite electrodes, based on the electrochemical peeling and etching of graphite flakes in negative electrodes, leading to the formation of CNTs and spherical nanoparticles, respectively. \copyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The structural characterization revealed that CNBs have excellent meso-macro hierarchical pore structure, with an averaged diameter size of 14.5 nm and a total pore volume of 1.13 cm3 g-1. The CNBs are aggregated forming inter-connected pore channels in different directions on both the meso- and macrometer length scales. The discharge capacity of CNBs reached 3600 mAh g-1, which exceeded the capacity of Ketjen Black EC-600JD (a commercial carbon black with highest cell performance) by 30-40\%. The excellent discharge capacity was contributed by the co-existence of high pore volume and meso-macro hierarchical porous structure. This new class carbon material exhibited higher discharge capacity compared to commercial porous carbon materials, and is possible to apply as the next generation of electrode materials in lithium-air (Li-air) battery. The structural and electrochemical properties accompanied with the synthesis mechanism of CNBs were discussed in details. \copyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis indicate that most S atoms in the S@G samples are stably combined with nanomesh graphene via covalent bonds rather than exist as free elemental S.

  abstract = {The market for supercapacitors is rapidly growing due to their high power capability, but their energy is low compared with batteries. However, their poor energy density can be modulated with redox additive electrode materials either by decoration or composite fabrication. In addition, the energy density of the supercapacitors could be increased using the redox reaction in the electrolyte itself. Herein, a high-energy supercapacitor is demonstrated using activated high surface area carbon derived from cauliflower and a redox additive electrolyte. The activated carbon shows mesopores with a specific surface area of {$\sim$}1500 m2 g-1, and a maximum specific capacitance of 310 F g-1 is achieved in a two-electrode symmetric configuration using 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. However, the fabricated device shows high specific capacitances of 78 and 92 F g-1 in non-aqueous organic and ionic liquid electrolytes with energy densities of 17 and 29 W h kg-1, respectively. The energy density of the supercapacitor device is further enhanced using the novel redox additive 0.01 M KI in Na2SO4 electrolyte. It shows a specific capacitance of 520 F g-1 and a maximum energy density of 58.5 W h kg-1, which is very high and comparable to that of lithium-ion batteries.}

The quasi solid-state electrolytes contain a biopolymer matrix, made of cellulose or chitin, and ionic liquid (IL), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMImBF4), which acts as a plasticizer and an ionic conductor. The gel biopolymer electrolytes were prepared by a novel, but simple method. It was based on the casting solution technique with an intermediate step of hydrogel production, followed by the exchanging of aqueous phase by IL plasticizer. Contrary to well-known hydrogel electrolytes, the biopolymer-based gels with IL could safely operate to high voltages, up to 3.0 V according to our experiments. The wide electrochemical stability allowed to extend the maximum energy density of gel electrolyte-based supercapacitors. Moreover, the investigated systems displayed a high performance in terms of specific capacitance, energy-power densities, and cyclability. There are compared to the reference cell with liquid electrolyte in terms of electrochemical characteristic, showing the specific capacitance values up to 140--145 F g-1, with excellent capacitance retention (ca. 90 \%) after 10,000 galvanostatic charge and discharge cycles.

  abstract = {Simple ecofriendly activation process of carbon obtained from coconut shell-based waste was used for the fabrication of non-volatile high performance supercapacitors. , Carbon from biomass as an active material for supercapacitor electrodes has attracted much interest due to its environmental soundness, abundance, and porous nature. In this context, activated carbon prepared from coconut shells via a simple activation process (water or steam as activation agents) was used as an active material in electrodes for eco-friendly supercapacitors. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, conductivity, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N 2 sorption and thermogravimetry coupled to mass spectrometry (TGA-MS) studies revealed that activated carbon produced by this approach exhibit a graphitic phase, a high surface area, and large pore volume.

Activated carbons have reached their capacitance limit because of their limited accessible surface area in organic electrolytes, commonly used in commercial supercapacitors. Herein, we reveal that a shift from organic electrolytes to polar hybrid electrolytes allows switching to smaller ions without a penalty on solubility and ionic conductivity, which in turn allows for smaller pores and higher capacitance. We show that elevated storage capability can be realized by matching the porosity of a hierarchically porous carbon to a water/acetonitrile hybrid electrolyte with sodium perchlorate. Leveraging the small size of ions along with good wetting by the hybrid electrolyte ensures fast ion diffusion and enhanced accessibility of ions to carbon pores. Using the hybrid electrolyte for our model coal-derived activated carbon, we fabricated a high-rate supercapacitor with the best capacitance and energy density reported to date for activated carbons (hybrid or organic electrolytes), including 41.2 F/g (18.3 F/cm3) and 35.0 Wh/Kg at 1 A/g. A commercial carbon with a higher surface area delivers comparable gravimetric capacitance but lower volumetric capacitance due to much lower density than our carbon (7.4 F/cm3).},

Four data normalization approaches, Min-Max Scaling, Mean, Z-score, and Gaussian function were assessed on experimental datasets. The LSTM algorithm, when combined with Min-Max normalization, showed the most favorable predictive capabilities, with a low Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Square Error (CVRMSE) of 10.3 and Normalized Mean Bias Error (NMBE) of 0.6. The remaining three normalization approaches showed satisfactory concordance with empirical data, but with slight disparities in precision. The LMBP model, when using Z-score normalization, had favorable performance in forecasting electricity consumption, but the discrepancies across the models were not significant. The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, when used with Gaussian normalization, exhibited the most favorable performance, with the lowest Coefficient of Variation of Root Mean Square Error (CVRMSE) at 11.8 and Normalized Mean Biased Error (NMBE) at 0.6. The Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) model, trained on unprocessed data, exhibited superior performance, with the lowest Coefficient of Variation of Root Mean Square Error (CVRMSE) at 19.2 and NMBE at 1.0. In conclusion, the study highlights the significant influence of data normalization on the predictive capabilities of various ANN models, suggesting that careful use of data normalization techniques can significantly improve the accuracy of electricity consumption forecasting in buildings.},

However, metals with close reduction potentials present a fundamental challenge for selective electrodeposition, especially for critical elements such as cobalt and nickel. Here, we demonstrate the synergistic combination of electrolyte control and interfacial design to achieve molecular selectivity for cobalt and nickel during potential-dependent electrodeposition. Concentrated chloride allows for the speciation control via distinct formation of anionic cobalt chloride complex (CoCl42-), while maintaining nickel in the cationic form ([Ni(H2O)5Cl]+). Furthermore, functionalizing electrodes with a positively charged polyelectrolyte (i.e., poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride) changes the mobility of CoCl42- by electrostatic stabilization, which tunes cobalt selectivity depending on the polyelectrolyte loading. This strategy is applied for the multicomponent metal recovery from commercially-sourced lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide electrodes. We report a final purity of 96.4 \textpm{} 3.1\% and 94.1 \textpm{} 2.3\% for cobalt and nickel, respectively. Based on a technoeconomic analysis, we identify the limiting costs arising from the background electrolyte, and provide a promising outlook of selective electrodeposition as an efficient separation approach for battery recycling.},

The ChCl:EG mixtures were compared to the ionic liquid (IL) 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([PYR13][TFSI]) and choline bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (ChTFSI) EG mixtures with the same molar ratios in order to understand the impact of the anion and hydrogen bond donor on solvation. Exchanging the chloride anion with TFSI is found to increase the fluidity of the solvent and promote stronger solute-solvent interactions. Raman spectroscopy suggests MVCl2 is strongly solvated by EG in ChTFSI:EG solutions and interstitially accommodated in holes in ChCl:EG mixtures and [PYR13][TFSI]. Complex solvents such as ILs and DESs are regarded as "designer solvents", and it is demonstrated here that the physical properties and solvation characteristics of these fluids strongly depend on the choice of the anion.},

Pretreated biomass using either heating technique gave glucose titers 100 times higher than raw rice hulls after enzymatic hydrolysis. FTIR analysis shows similar findings for both heating techniques. For biomass pretreatment using DESs, microwave heating requires less than half of the energy (0.10 kW-h) compared to conductive heating (0.31 kW-h). Conductive heating requires more residence time of biomass for the pretreatment process. Thus, this work shows the potential benefits of a microwave heating technique for deconstruction of biomass using DESs.},

These contaminants limit the use of CBp as a carbon source for energy storage applications such as supercapacitors. This study aims to improve the physicochemical, morphological, and electrochemical properties of CBp by applying different chemical treatments and activation methods. The chemical treatments include acid (HCl), base (NaOH), acid-base (HCl/NaOH), and desulphurization (NaOH in xylene) processes to remove impurities such as sulphur, zinc, and silicon. The treated CBp samples are then activated by KOH impregnation technique to increase the surface area and porosity. The characterizations of the treated CBp samples are performed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and Brunner Emmett Teller (BET). The electrochemical performance of the treated CBp samples are evaluated using galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that the chemical treatments significantly reduce the impurity levels and enhance the electrochemical performance of CBp. The desulphurized CBp sample exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 218 F/g among the treated CBp samples. The findings of this study suggest that CBp can be effectively utilized as a potential carbon source for supercapacitor electrodes by applying suitable chemical treatments and activation methods. This will create a circular economy to valorize CBp.},

  abstract = {Li-Ion batteries will play an important role in reaching emission targets by sustaining the further integration of renewable energy technologies and Electric Vehicles (EVs) in society. Their performance however is quite sensitive to temperature, leading to capacity fade, acceleration of ageing effect and possible thermal runaway. A Thermal Management System (TMS) should maintain a battery at an operating temperature within an optimal range and maximise temperature uniformity, i.e. approaching an isothermal condition. Many studies have experimentally investigated the electrical performance of Li-Ion batteries under controlled environmental temperatures. Notably however, these controlled conditions do not impose a uniform temperature or a controlled rate of cooling, as a TMS would. From a review of the relevant literature a ratio of the heat generation to the power production is proposed, i.e. quantifying an equivalent electro-chemical efficiency to advance research in this technological area and as additional TMS design metric. Overall, there is enough evidence that 25--30 {$^\circ$}C is the best temperature range to minimise the ageing effect while 25--40 {$^\circ$}C is typically reported as the general Li-Ion cells operating range. No specific temperature is identified to optimise the cycle electro-chemical efficiency and minimise the ageing effect. Therefore, a TMS should keep Li-Ion batteries within a specific temperature range according to the need for either higher electro-chemical efficiencies (i.e. higher powers and lower heat generation rates) or higher operating life. There are four main thermal management approaches of Li-Ion batteries: air-cooling, liquid-cooling, boiling and Phase Change Materials (PCM). Air cooling is preferred for safety reasons but is less efficient as the rate of heat transfer achievable is relatively low. Forced air cooling can effectively keep the temperature at a preferred level but fails to guarantee a uniform temperature. Liquid cooling is better in terms of heat transfer performance, but it is less safe and can still result in significant thermal gradients within the pack. Boiling effectively keeps Li-Ion cells temperature constant and uniform but can be quite complex to operate and control. Phase Change Materials (PCMs) as a passive cooling approach are proposed as an effective and low-cost isothermalisation technique. However, when Li-Ion batteries are operated under extreme conditions (high ambient temperature, high discharge rates), PCM are not able to recover all latent energy potential during solidification and this leads to possible thermal runaway. Overall, it is clear that no TMS alone is holistically better than others and the choice between air cooling, liquid cooling, boiling and latent heat PCM systems is entirely linked to the specific combination of temperatures, heat rates, cells capacity and geometry. Active PCM systems however, mainly a combination of liquid cooling and passive PCM, show promising results towards an ideal isothermal condition. Also, they introduce the potential to store the thermal energy and use it as needed, converting a Li-Ion cell from an Electrical Energy Storage System (EESS) to a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system.},

Five percent of the world's natural rubber is consumed in tyres used in the EU, using up to a quarter of the area under rubber plantations in some producing countries. Car use is responsible for 58\% of this consumption, due to car-dependent lifestyles that are associated with economic prosperity and spatial planning paradigms.

  abstract = {Flexible electromagnetic shielding composite material has good deformation ability and stable electromagnetic shielding performance. In this paper, Au@CNT/sodium alginate/polydimethylsiloxane flexible composites are prepared by infiltrating PDMS polymer into Au@CNT/sodium alginate sponge skeleton. Nano-scale Au particles coated on CNT surface can effectively improve the electrical conductivity and electromagnetic shielding performance of the composite. The experimental results show that the log function values of conductivity and electromagnetic shielding performance obey a quasi linear relationship. After 10\% elastic tensile strain, the conductivity of all samples are remain unchanged, which indicate a stable electromagnetic shielding performance under strain. Combined with the multi-scale model analysis, the mechanism of electrical stability and the effect of Au sizes and cladding rate are discussed. Calculation results show that the electromagnetic shielding performance of the flexible composite sample could reach more than 60 dB. These flexible shielding composites with stable performance under strain may have good application potential, such as for wearable smart electronics.},

  abstract = {Aluminum has long attracted attention as an anode material because of its high theoretical voltage and specific energy. This article is a brief introduction to chemistry and electrochemistry of elemental aluminum. The metal is unique because of the formation of an impervious and adherent oxide surface layer, which makes the metal remarkable for its corrosion and wear resistance. As a result, electroplating of aluminum is a widely used technique for corrosion protection of other metals. To prepare better and varied oxide layers, the electrolytic process, anodizing, is developed. On the contrary, the oxide layer is detrimental to aluminum anode performance in batteries. Electrode activation and corrosion depression are therefore the main focus for developing aluminum alloys as anode materials for primary and metal-air batteries as well as for cathodic protection. Electrochemically, aluminum has a very negative electrode potential and can only be deposited from nonaqueous electrolytes. Electrolytic production, refining, and plating of aluminum and development of rechargeable aluminum batteries employ either molten salt or organic electrolytes. These technologies constitute the principal branches of aluminum electrochemistry and are therefore the main focal points of discussion in this article.},

Hydrometallurgical approach has attracted extensive research due to its potential to reduce the consumption of energy and threat to the environment. However, the simultaneous realization of green, efficient and closed-loop recycling is still challenging. Herein, we report a closed-loop and highly efficient approach to recycle lithium cobalt oxide from spent LIBs based on a choline chloride:oxalic acid (ChCl:OA) type deep eutectic solvent (DES). An ultrafast leaching process is observed at 180 {$^\circ$}C for 10 s with no observable residues. The energy barrier during leaching is calculated to be 113.9 kJ/mol. Noteworthy, the solubility of cobalt ions can be reversibly tuned by simply adding/evaporating deionized water, thus avoiding the addition of precipitant and enabling the easy recovery of the leaching solvent for realizing a closed-loop recycling process. The simultaneous realization of high efficiency, green and closed-loop process is expected to push the DES into practical application for recycling the electrodes of LIBs.},

The development of clean, efficient, and simple extraction methods for critical metals, as well as new technologies for the high-value utilization of critical metals in secondary resources will help to achieve a sustainable supply of critical metals and promote the rapid development of strategic emerging industries. High temperature molten salt electrolysis is an economical and green metal extraction method that plays a vital role in energy supply and resource extraction. Therefore, this article aims to review the application of high temperature molten salt electrolysis technology in the extraction and recovery of critical metals. First, the application status of high temperature molten salt electrolysis technology in aluminum and titanium industries was taken as an example, and the technical methods and technical difficulties in the extraction of critical metals from raw ore resources are introduced and analyzed. After that, the high temperature molten salt electrolysis technology was introduced into the field of secondary resources recovery, and the application of molten salt electrolysis technology in secondary resources, such as spent lithium-ion batteries, abandoned rare earth metal materials, spent fuel, and waste cemented carbide scrap, was systematically summarized.

A sol-gel method is utilized to resynthesize LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 from the leachate. Lactic acid is chosen as a leaching and chelating agent. The leaching efficiency is investigated by determining the contents of metal elements such as Li, Ni, Co, and Mn in the leachate using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. The spent cathode materials for the pretreatment process and the regenerated and freshly synthesized materials are examined using X-ray diffraction and scanning electronic microscopy.

These drawbacks are due to limited accessible surface area and poor ion diffusion capacity arising from the agglomeration and restacking of graphene nanosheets during electrode assembly. To solve the above issues, perforation on the graphene planes is adopted, which bestows the graphene-based nanomaterials with porous architectures. In particular, in-plane holes are capable of accelerating ion transport across the graphene sheets and ultimately accessing the inner electrode surface. Here, a comprehensive review of holey graphene-based nanomaterials is presented, which summarizes recent progress from their rational design and controlled synthesis to their applications in electrochemical energy storage. Finally, perspectives on the future directions of their large-scale synthesis and advanced assembly protocols as electrodes are proposed and discussed.},

Based on the energetics of the redox reaction between carbon and the above oxysalts, a general mechanistic explanation for the pore formation and the activation process in MS is presented.

Waste of Li-ion batteries was pyrolyzed in a nitrogen atmosphere at 400, 500, 600, and 700 {$^\circ$}C for 30, 60, and 90 min. Thermodynamic calculations for the carbothermic reduction of active materials LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, and LiNiO2 by graphite and gas products were performed and compared to the experimental data. Ni, Mn, and Co (NMC) cathode materials recovered from spent Li-ion batteries were also studied. The results indicate that the organic compounds and the graphite are oxidized by oxygen from the active material and provide the reductive atmosphere. Such removal of the organic components increases the purity of the metal bearing material. Reactions with C and CO(g) led to a reduction of metal oxides with Co, CoO, Ni, NiO, Mn, Mn3O4, Li2O, and Li2CO3 as the main products. The reduction reactions transformed the metal compounds in the untreated LiB black mass to more soluble chemical forms. It was concluded that the pyrolysis can be used as an effective tool for the battery waste pretreatment to increase the efficiency of the leaching in hydrometallurgical processing of the black mass. The results obtained can help to optimize the parameters in the industrial processing already used for Li-ion battery recycling, especially if followed by hydrometallurgical treatment. Such optimization will decrease the energy demand and increase the metal recovery rate and utilization of the byproducts.},

Scientists and regulators sometimes group these EC-containing particles together, for example, interchangeably using the terms carbon black and black carbon despite one being a manufactured product with well-controlled properties and the other being an undesired, incomplete-combustion byproduct with diverse properties. In this critical review, we synthesize information on the contrasting properties of EC-containing particles in order to highlight significant differences that can affect hazard potential. We demonstrate why carbon black should not be considered a model particle representative of either combustion soots or engineered carbon-based nanomaterials. Overall, scientific studies need to distinguish these highly different EC-containing particles with care and precision so as to forestall unwarranted extrapolation of properties, hazard potential, and study conclusions from one material to another.},

  abstract = {With the development of large-scale energy storage and the electric-vehicle market, the demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is increasing, resulting in the explosive increase in spent LIBs. The cathode materials of spent LIBs contain multiple transition elements, such as lithium (Li), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), and manganese (Mn). The recovery of these metals has significant environmental benefits and high economic value. As a green solvent, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) show great potential in recovering valuable metal elements from spent LIBs. Here, this study proposed a new type of DES formed from betaine hydrochloride and ethylene glycol (betaine hydrochloride and ethylene glycol at a 1 : 5 molar ratio), which can efficiently leach metal elements from spent Ni-Co-Mn lithium batteries (LNCM). The leaching rates of Ni, Co, Mn, and Li can all reach 99\% under the conditions of T = 140 {$^\circ$}C, t = 10 min and no reductant. Compared with the traditional leaching process, this study provided an economical, green, and efficient approach to recover valuable metals from spent LIBs.}

Herein, an oxalic acid-based deep eutectic solvent (DES) with the weak acidic character and reducibility of oxalic acid was designed for the recovery of valuable metals from spent LIBs via a sustainable and convenient process. Nearly 96.1\% of Li and 96.3\% of Co can be extracted from lithium cobalt oxide at 120 {$^\circ$}C. The DES can extract valuable metals from cathode materials and separate metal ions by itself after extraction without destroying its own structure in a one-pot extraction process. The composition and the structure of DES have been maximum retained and could be intact recycled for another recovery process. After five cycles, the Li and Co extraction efficiencies were maintained above 92.9 and 74.5\%, respectively.

First time, lithium was selectively leached using formic acid as lixiviant with H2O2 as an oxidant. Effect of different parameters i.e., formic acid and H2O2 concentration, pulp density, temperature and time have been studied. The optimised leaching conditions were used for the selective leaching of Li and Li was precipitated as Li3PO4 in two steps, i.e., firstly, in situ precipitation at pH = 12.5, 60 {$^\circ$}C and then at pH = 12.5, 90 {$^\circ$}C using saturated Na3PO4 solution from the pregnant leach solution. The products were recovered with high purity ({$>$}99.5\%) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) techniques were used for characterization. The overall study confirmed the suitability of the developed scheme for industrial application to provide economic and environmental benefits. Green chemistry metrics and the revenue generated from the developed process were calculated which revealed that the process is indeed green, sustainable, and economic.},

The unprecedented growth trajectory in lithium-ion battery manufacturing perpetuated by the inception of electric vehicles (EV) results in a vast amount of spent LIBs reaching their end of life (EOL). From the perspective of resource circulation, procurement, and sustainability with an insight into the circular economy, an effective recycling system must be developed to recycle the spent LIBs. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of pyrometallurgical options for recycling spent LIBs. In particular, this study summarizes the thermal pretreatment methods used to recover the active cathode material and then discusses the developed extractive pyrometallurgical options for recycling spent LIBs. A summary is presented on some recent examples of laboratory and industrial-scale recycling processes to demonstrate the practical applications of pyrometallurgical options for recycling. Finally, the review sheds light on the battery recycling legislation, and challenges and future outlook for recycling LIBs are also discussed.},

The effect of various quantity ratios of molten salts and the spent-LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (SNCM) material on preparation and electrochemical properties of the regenerated submicron-sized LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 crystals has been studied in detailed. The lithium deficiency, degraded crystal structure and impure surface of SNCM are successfully restored in liquid medium of lithium-contained molten salt. The structural restoring, structure stability and capacity recovering of the regenerated samples are determined by the environment of molten salts. The optimized regenerated sample MS1.1 delivers the highest initial capacity of 152.5 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C rate, and it remains 86\% capacity after 100 cycles. MS1.1 with the smallest charge transfer resistance delivers the highest capacity of 133.4 mAh g-1 at 5 C rate, and it presents excellent cyclic stability for 500 cycles. After 100 cycles, stable crystal morphology of MS1.1 is still maintained, and MS1.1 induces less side reactions and low quantity of by-products. The restored electrochemical performances of MS1.1 sample prove that the molten salt-assisted regeneration maybe a facial and effective method for other spent cathode materials.},

First, reduction roasting which used spent anode powder as reduction agent and water immersion are applied to preferentially recover lithium. Subsequently, an ammonia leaching method is adopted to eff ;ectively separate nickel and cobalt from water immersion residue. Results indicate that Li2CO3, (NiO)m{$\cdot$}(MnO)n, Ni, Co are the ultimate reduction products at 650 {$^\circ$}C for 1 h with 5\% anode powder. 82.2 \% Li is preferentially leached via water immersion after reduction roasting and Li2CO3 products are obtained by evaporation crystallization. Thermodynamics shows that reducing ammonia leaching is feasible for water immersion residue. Amounts of 97.7 \% Ni and 99.1 \% Co can be selectively leached by NH3{$\cdot$}H2O and (NH4)2SO3 while Mn remain in the residue as (NH4)2Mn(SO3)2{$\cdot$}H2O, (NH4)2Mn(SO4)2{$\cdot$}6H2O and (NH4)2Mn2(SO3)3 under the optimized conditions. Ammonia leaching kinetic show the activation energy of Ni and Co is 84.44 kJ/mol and 91.73 kJ/mol, which indicate the controlling steps are the chemical reaction. Summarily, the whole process achieves the maximum degree of selective recovery and reduces the environmental pollution caused by the multistep purification.},

In particular, choline chloride (ChCl)-based DESs are one of the most commonly used representatives of these fluids. Nevertheless, in order to apply DESs in some fields, it is essential to guarantee their stability, reusability, and biocompatibility. In this context, the long-term stability of three ChCl-based DESs formed using glucose, malonic acid, and urea as hydrogen bond donors was investigated. Furthermore, the possible formation of toxic byproducts during long-term heating was evaluated for the first time, and toxicological studies using three bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus) were performed. ChCl:urea DES revealed a high long-term thermal stability and was also found to be less toxic to the bacteria and thus can be considered as green solvent. ChCl:glucose DES started to decompose as a result of possible caramelization at 100 {$^\circ$}C, and decomposition was further promoted at more elevated temperatures. Degradation of this DES did not affect greatly the toxicity toward bacteria, and low antibacterial properties were observed. The applicability of ChCl:malonic DES is not recommended as this DES was shown to be thermally unstable due to esterification and decomposition of malonic acid into acetic acid and carbon dioxide. Moreover, high toxicity of this DES in comparison to other DESs assayed in this study was reported.}

TR and the resulting fire and explosion have been responsible for several high-profile accidents and product recalls over the past decade. Herein, the causes of TR are described and novel preventative methods are examined, approaching the problem from different angles by altering the internal structure of the battery to undergo thermal shutdown or developing the battery and thermal management systems so that they can detect and prevent TR. Ultimately, a variety of different technologies is needed to address the emerging market of highly specialized lithium-ion batteries. Key innovations discussed include positive temperature coefficient (PTC) materials, self-healing polymer electrolytes, and hybrid liquid?solid-state electrolytes. Mist cooling achieves a highly uniform temperature inside the battery pack without the need for pumps to circulate a coolant. The development of battery management systems (BMSs) which model the internal temperature of the cell from real-time data and prevent the cell reaching a critical temperature is an essential area for further research.},

The invention resides in the crosslinking of a polymeric cellulose, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), within the carbon bodies after they are shaped, employing the CMC as a binder for the activated carbon. The approach to attain product mechanical strength and water stability by crosslinking rather than high temperature heat treatment is not obvious from the prior art teaching. The crosslinking reaction occurs at temperatures below 270{$^\circ$} C. In addition, this new binder technology produces shaped carbon bodies having key properties beyond the best level that has been accomplished with other binders.}

  abstract = {Rapid advancements in modern electronics have been starved of further breakthroughs to achieve high-energy, large-power, and long-running energy storage devices. Carbon-based supercapacitors (CSs) are promising large-power systems that can store electrical energy at the interface between the carbonaceous electrode surface and adsorbed electrolyte layer. However, commercial CSs using activated carbons suffer from limited energy densities in the organic electrolytes owing to sluggish mass diffusion and restricted charge accumulation. To overcome these issues, significant efforts have been devoted toward increasing the energy storage of CSs by the exploration of both large-capacitance electrodes and high-potential electrolytes. This paper reviews the recent advances made in the two core components (i.e., electrodes and electrolytes) of CSs. Firstly, we describe the involved energy storage mechanisms of CSs, followed by a brief overview of the key factors affecting the electrochemical performances. Then, novel design concepts have been summarized that can be used to fabricate carbon-based electrodes, such as microporous carbons, mesoporous carbons, hierarchical porous carbons, functionalized carbons, and carbon composites. Further, tailoring of the geometrical morphologies, pore structures, and surface functionalities can be discussed in pursuit of large-capacitance electrodes. Furthermore, various types of aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes, such as water-in-salt, organic media, ionic liquids, and (quasi-)solid-state electrolytes, have been systematically investigated to settle the water hydrolysis concern of traditional electrolytes. Finally, the challenges in maximizing the synergistic effect between the electrodes and electrolytes are summarized, and we have proposed the future outlook for the development of advanced CSs.},

However, they often make use of CNTs as fillers in covalently cross-linked hydrogel networks or involve direct cross-linking between CNTs and polymer chains, limiting processability properties. Herein, nanocomposite hydrogels are developed, in which CNTs are fillers in a physically cross-linked hydrogel. Supramolecular nanocomposites are prepared at various CNT concentrations, ranging from 0.5 to 6 wt\%. Incorporation of 3 wt\% of CNTs leads to an increase of the material's toughness by over 80\%, and it enhances electrical conductivity by 358\%, compared to CNT-free hydrogel. Meanwhile, the nanocomposite hydrogels maintain thixotropy and processability, typical of the parent hydrogel. The study also demonstrates that these materials display remarkable cytocompatibility and support cell growth and proliferation, while preserving their functional activities. These supramolecular nanocomposite hydrogels are therefore promising candidates for biomedical applications, in which both toughness and electrical conductivity are important parameters.},

Addition of 25 wt \% calcium carbonate powder to the PCM is found to arrest the material leakage during solid-liquid phase transition and the form-stable PCM showed superior thermal and mechanical properties. Thermal conductivity enhanced by {$\sim$}195\% for the PCM loaded with 3.5 wt \% of CBNP nano-inclusions, which is attributed to the development of interconnected percolation networks during solidification of the PCM. Superior volume filling capability and compressibility of CBNP nano-inclusions further augmented thermal conductivity enhancements in solid state. The micro-scale aggregation phenomena and the formation of quasi-2D percolation networks is observed in real time using timed stamped optical phase contrast video-microscopy. The {$\sim$}134\% enhancement in photo-thermal conversion is attributed to the augmentation of extinction efficiency of the incident radiation due to multiple scattering from the micro-sized CBNP clusters, within the PCM host matrix. The excellent photo-thermal efficiency, high thermal conductivity, low cost and enhanced form-stability of the CBNP loaded PCMs at elevated temperature make them economically attractive choice for latent heat thermal energy storage applications.},

Calcium electrowinning has been performed in a 5--10wt\% calcium oxide--calcium chloride molten salt by the electrolytic dissociation of calcium oxide. This electrolysis requires the use of a porous ceramic sheath around the anode to keep the cathodically deposited calcium and the anodic gases separate. Stainless steel cathode and graphite anode have been used in the temperature range of 850--950{$^\circ$}C. This salt mixture is produced as a result of the direct oxide reduction (DOR) of reactive metal oxides by calcium in a calcium chloride bath. The primary purpose of this process is to recover the expensive calcium reductant and to recycle calcium chloride. Experimental data have been included to justify the suitability as well as limitations of the electrowinning process. Transport of oxygen ions through the sheath is found to be the rate controlling step. Under the constraints of the reactor design, a calcium recovery rate of approx. 150g/h was achieved. Feasibility of a process to produce metals by pyrometallurgical reduction, using the calcium reductant produced electrolytically within the same reactor, has been shown in a hybrid process. Several processes are currently under investigation to use this electrowon calcium for in situ reduction of metal oxides.},

DES composed of choline chloride and lactic acid could leach Li, Mn, Co, and Ni, achieving efficiency of 100 \% under much milder conditions with respect to the previous literature. For the first time, to our best knowledge, a two-step approach was reported in the case of LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 for selective recovery of Li, Co, and Ni with high yield and purity. Furthermore, other cathode components, namely aluminum current collector and binder, were found to be not dissolved by the proposed DES, thus making a simple separation from the active material possible. Finally, this strategy was designed to easily regenerate and reuse the leaching solvents for more than one extraction, thus further boosting process sustainability.},

The generalization error is bounded by sum of two offset Rademacher complexities: the main term is Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis class with minus offset induced by the perturbation variance, which characterizes data-dependent regularization by the random perturbation; the auxiliary term is offset Rademacher complexity for the variance class, controlling the degree to which this regularization effect can be weakened. For neural networks, we estimate upper and lower bounds for the variance induced by truthful dropout, a variant of dropout that we propose to ensure unbiased output and fit into our framework, and the variance bounds exhibits connection to adaptive regularization methods. By applying our framework to ReLU networks with one hidden layer, a generalization upper bound is derived with no assumptions on the parameter norms or data distribution, with O(1/n)O(1/n)O(1/n) fast rate and adaptivity to geometry of data points being achieved at the same time.},

However, traditional experimental methods for optimizing MnO2-based SCs are often time-intensive and limited in addressing key performance bottlenecks. To overcome these challenges, we employed machine learning (ML) techniques to identify optimal synthesis, fabrication, and electrochemical testing conditions for MnO2 SCs. A comprehensive dataset comprising approximately 5000 property entries was compiled from peer-reviewed publications. Using Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis, we extracted interpretable decision rules and assessed the impact of various input features on key performance metrics of MnO2 SCs (specific capacitance, cyclic stability, and capacitance retention). Feature importance scores were evaluated, and predictive models were developed using multiple ML algorithms. Herein, the random forest model exhibited the highest predictive accuracy. The ML insights were validated experimentally by fabricating MnO2 electrodes guided by CART-optimized conditions. The resulting MnO2 SC achieved a specific capacitance of 498\,F/g, excellent cyclic stability over 10,000 cycles with 84.12\,\% capacitance retention, and a coulombic efficiency of 95.52\,\%. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of data-driven approaches in predicting and optimizing the performance of MnO2-based SCs, offering a robust framework for accelerating the design of energy storage devices.},

This widespread use in a multitude of industrial and private applications leads to the need for recycling and reutilization of their constituent components. Improving the ``recycling technology'' of lithium ion batteries is a continuous effort and recycling is far from maturity today. The complexity of lithium ion batteries with varying active and inactive material chemistries interferes with the desire to establish one robust recycling procedure for all kinds of lithium ion batteries. Therefore, the current state of the art needs to be analyzed, improved, and adapted for the coming cell chemistries and components. This paper provides an overview of regulations and new battery directive demands. It covers current practices in material collection, sorting, transportation, handling, and recycling. Future generations of batteries will further increase the diversity of cell chemistry and components. Therefore, this paper presents predictions related to the challenges of future battery recycling with regard to battery materials and chemical composition, and discusses future approaches to battery recycling.},

The advantages of lithium primary cells are a high operating voltage, a high specific energy and energy density, excellent discharge and storage characteristics, a wide operating temperature range, and so on. In order to take advantage of the unique properties of lithium, such as the highest negative electrode potential and lowest specific gravity among metals, many kinds of positive electrode and electrolyte materials were studied. As a result, a variety of lithium cell systems have been commercialized for both general consumer uses and special uses.

  abstract = {Fossil fuels, particularly crude oil, have proven to be a source of energy to households, transportation and power industries over the past decades. This natural reserve is diminishing at an alarming rate with crude oil having reserves to last the earth for the next half a century. As a result, researchers are constantly seeking remedial technologies to close this gap. Thermochemical conversion processes such as pyrolysis, gasification and liquefaction (PGL) offer an alternative solution to mitigating the world's high reliance on crude oil. These processes can be employed to provide energy, fuel and high-end value-added products. This paper aims to highlight all the research and development advancements and trends that have been made over the past three decades while employing waste tyres and other feedstock. In addition, the prominent countries and their associated researchers who have made novel discoveries in the field of thermochemical conversion are extensively discussed. The research findings show that significant research outputs such as the utilization of vast types of feed materials, the reaction mechanisms, the factors affecting the processes, and the application of the different end-products for thermochemical processes are well documented in the literature. Also, the collected data showed that significant advancements have been achieved in developing PGL technologies. The following conclusions were drawn: (i) PGL technologies show a generally increasing percentage interest from 1990 to 2020, (ii) many authors have identified the end-products obtained from waste feedstocks, such as; waste tyres, biomass, plastics, food waste, microalgae and animal manure to yield promising application benefits, (iii) China has shown the greatest interest in investing into waste to energy initiatives and has demonstrated the vast applications of waste derived products and, (iv) employing waste tyres as a feedstock has shown potential for producing high-end value products in their crude form or refined form. Some of the shortcomings identified during the study are the modest interest shown by most African regions as well as the lack of regulatory frameworks developed by certain countries.}

  abstract = {Sustained growth in lithium-ion battery (LIB) demand within the transportation sector (and the electricity sector) motivates detailed investigations of whether future raw materials supply will reconcile with resulting material requirements for these batteries. We track the metal content associated with compounds used in LIBs. We find that most of the key constituents, including manganese, nickel, and natural graphite, have sufficient supply to meet the anticipated increase in demand for LIBs. There may be challenges in rapidly scaling the use of materials associated with lithium and cobalt in the short term. Due to long battery lifetimes and multiple end uses, recycling is unlikely to provide significant short-term supply. There are risks associated with the geopolitical concentrations of these elements, particularly for cobalt. The lessons revealed in this work can be relevant to other industries in which the rapid growth of a materials-dependent technology disrupts the global supply of those materials. The key conclusions of this perspective have shown that the supply of most materials contained within lithium-ion batteries will likely meet the demand for the near future. However, there are potential risks associated with the supply of cobalt. Furthermore, if there is rapid adoption of electric vehicles (incentivized by policy interventions including a carbon tax, higher fuel taxes, and more aggressive Corporate Average Fuel Economy targets), demand could outpace supply for some battery-grade materials (even for lithium in the very near term). The implications for research based on this perspective span many scales. First, continued research into cathode materials that alleviate some of these supply issues is of interest, particularly those that are cobalt free. Supply chain research and investigations in the policy domain may also help uncover ways to address materials availability in the future. Future investigations should provide a dynamic analysis with sufficient detail to map technological and operational changes to their impact on cost and to map performance to market value. There has been continued growth in lithium-ion battery-powered electric vehicles. This puts new pressure on the supply of materials used in these products. We present an analysis of supply chain issues for lithium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, and natural graphite focused first on their potential supply concerns and then the scaled demand for these materials. This contribution provides practical considerations that should factor into sustainable energy research, particularly as it relates to global impact on materials supply chains.},

  abstract = {Worldwide trends in mobile electrification, largely driven by the popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) will skyrocket demands for lithium-ion battery (LIB) production. As such, up to four million metric tons of LIB waste from EV battery packs could be generated from 2015 to 2040. LIB recycling directly addresses concerns over long-term economic strains due to the uneven geographic distribution of resources (especially for Co and Li) and environmental issues associated with both landfilling and raw material extraction. However, LIB recycling infrastructure has not been widely adopted, and current facilities are mostly focused on Co recovery for economic gains. This incentive will decline due to shifting market trends from LiCoO2 toward cobalt-deficient and mixed-metal cathodes (eg, LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2). Thus, this review covers recycling strategies to recover metals in mixed-metal LIB cathodes and comingled scrap comprising different chemistries. As such, hydrometallurgical processes can meet this criterion, while also requiring a low environmental footprint and energy consumption compared to pyrometallurgy. Following pretreatment to separate the cathode from other battery components, the active material is dissolved entirely by reductive acid leaching. A complex leachate is generated, comprising cathode metals (Li+, Ni2+, Mn2+, and Co2+) and impurities (Fe3+, Al3+, and Cu2+) from the current collectors and battery casing, which can be separated and purified using a series of selective precipitation and/or solvent extraction steps. Alternatively, the cathode can be resynthesized directly from the leachate.},

As a result, massive amounts of solid waste are generated from the end-of-life LIBs and expected to increase by two- to threefolds in the near future. Without proper recycling strategies and infrastructure, the immediate threat of environmental pollution and wastage of resources is clear. One way to circumvent these challenges is to recycle the spent LIBs and recover the components and materials, especially heavy metals for future repurposing applications. This review highlights the recent discoveries on the use of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as an economical and environmentally friendly medium for metal recovery from spent LIBs. Herein, how the different hydrogen donors and acceptors affect the overall performance of DES in terms of leaching efficiency, time, temperature, and metal recovery rates are outlined. Very importantly, the mechanism of metal leaching from the metal oxides using DES is discussed. Finally, some potential strategies and opportunities for further development of novel DES for metal-recovery from not only spent LIBs but also other industries such as, mining, oil, and agriculture are outlined.}

Considerable research efforts have been devoted to the development of novel synthesis strategy for the preparation of porous carbon materials in recent years. In particular, molten salt strategy represents an emerging and promising method, whereby it has shown great potential in achieving tailored production of porous carbon. It has been proved that the molten salt-assisted production of carbon via the direct carbonization of carbonaceous precursors is an effective approach. Furthermore, with the incorporation of electrochemical technology, molten salt synthesis of porous carbon has become flexible and diversiform. Here, this review focuses on the mainstream molten salt synthesis strategies for the production of porous carbon materials, which includes direct molten salt carbonization process, capture and electrochemical conversion of CO2 to value-added carbon, electrochemical exfoliation of graphite to graphene-based materials, and electrochemical etching of carbides to new-type carbide-derived carbon materials. The reaction mechanisms and recent advances for these strategies are reviewed and discussed systematically. The morphological and structural properties and capacitive performances of the obtained carbon materials are summarized to reveal their appealing points for supercapacitor applications. Moreover, the opportunities and challenges of the molten salt synthesis strategy for the preparation of carbon materials are also discussed in this review to provide inspiration to the future researches.}

However, the employment of HBDs that have stronger complexing abilities was proven to have a greater effect on the solubility. The strongly coordinating HBDs increased metal oxide solubility via surface complexation reactions followed by ligand exchange for chloride in the bulk solvent. Differing selectivity for leaching of metal oxides was demonstrated, with solubility shown to be broadly dependent on lattice energy and Gibbs energy of formation of the metal oxide, while dissolution kinetics for metal oxides are shown to vary significantly.

  abstract = {Recycling of cobalt from end-of-life lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is gaining interest because they are increasingly used in commercial applications such as electrical vehicles. A common LIB cathode material is lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2). Besides the cathode, LIBs contain other components, such as metallic aluminium and copper as current collectors, which are often separated at initial hydrometallurgical recycling stages. Leaching of cobalt from LiCoO2 is mainly driven by reducing cobalt(iii) in LiCoO2 to cobalt(ii) via adding reducing agents. In this work, a green, cheap and safe approach is proposed by using a choline chloride-citric acid deep-eutectic solvent (DES) as lixiviant. Aluminium and copper were evaluated as reducing agents for cobalt(iii). After optimisation, lithium and cobalt were quantitatively leached from LiCoO2 in the presence of aluminium and copper. Copper was the most effective reducing agent for cobalt(iii), so that no additional reducing agents or a pre-separation step were required. A speciation study of the pregnant leach solution (PLS) confirmed the dominance of chloro complexes. DES leaching was compared with conventional hydrochloric acid leaching, whereby the DES avoided the formation of toxic chlorine gas. Finally, the DES PLS was used as the more polar phase in a non-aqueous solvent extraction process. This process consisted of a copper(i/ii) extraction step with the extractant LIX 984, followed by selective extraction of cobalt(ii) with the extractant Aliquat 336. Both metals were completely stripped from the loaded organic phases by oxalic acid. The total recovery yield of cobalt was 81\%, as a 99.9\% pure oxalate precipitate.}

Supercapacitors are considered as incredible energy-storing devices due to high power density, longevity, exceptional charge/discharge cycling stability, and low cost. The electrochemical performance of the supercapacitors absolutely relies upon the choice of its establishing parts like electrodes, binder, separator, electrolyte, and current collector; and its manufacture strategy. The part of polymers in this field is inescapable and has a background marked by many years. This review deliberately extends the part of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF); its copolymer and nanocomposites as a binder, separator, electrolyte, and piezoelectric generator in the development of supercapacitors. Polyvinylidene fluoride is a semi-crystalline polymer and the second-biggest fluoropolymer underway. It displays great mechanical properties, high dielectric consistent, wettability, and excellent thermal and chemical strength. Today, PVDF is quite possibly the most requesting polymers because of its self-polarizing capacity under the electric field. The piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric properties of PVDF pulls into the consideration of researchers and specialists who are working in the development of self-charging supercapacitors and other energy reaping and storing gadgets. This review succinctly uncovers the future viewpoint for the advancement of PVDF-based self-powering electronic gadgets.},

Spent LIBs contain hazardous metals (such as Li, Co, Ni, and Mn), toxic and corrosive electrolytes, metal casting, and polymer binders that pose a serious threat to the environment and human health. Additionally, spent LIBs may serve as an economic source for transition metals, which could be applied to redesigning under a closed-circuit recycling process. Thus, the development of environmentally benign, low cost, and efficient processes for recycling of LIBs for a sustainable future has attracted worldwide attention. Therefore, herein, we introduce the concept of LIBs and review state-of-art technologies for metal recycling processes. Moreover, we emphasize on LIB pretreatment approaches, metal extraction, and pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical, and biometallurgical approaches. Direct recycling technologies combined with the profitable and sustainable cathode healing technology have significant potential for the recycling of LIBs without decomposition into substituent elements or precipitation; hence, these technologies can be industrially adopted for EV batteries. Finally, commercial technological developments, existing challenges, and suggestions are presented for the development of effective, environmentally friendly recycling technology for the future.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence and machine learning have become indispensable tools across various disciplines in the present century. In that way, the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in energy storage devices was investigated. As a preliminary study, the data derived from electrochemical studies were used for the prediction. The prediction of current from cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies was undertaken for bismuth ferrite (BFO), substitution of zinc in BFO (BFZO), and substitution of cobalt in BFO composite (BFCO). CV is a vital electrochemical technique used for studying the electrochemical behavior of any material. The electrochemical study provides insights into the energy storage behavior of the material through the specific capacitance. The machine learning models, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost (XGB), are trained and implemented to predict current at different scan rates. These models are trained and validated using the data collected from a CHI 600E electrochemical workstation. Multiple trials of experiments were performed to build the most optimum model for the material. The predicted values provide promising results and align well with the experimental data. The XGBoost, ANN and RF models perform well for the CV data set with an average testing accuracy {$>$}97\%. Also, a meta-model was created using stacking of the above three machine learning models which further improved the predictive performance, achieving a slightly higher average testing accuracy of over 97.73\%. The outcomes from the models can promote the development of machine learning applications in the field of electrochemistry and provide insights into optimizing supercapacitor performance and design through data-driven approaches.},

Some roadblocks are a lack of knowledge regarding how to influence and address colloidal forces, as well as a lack of practical devices to understand these systems. This review focuses on applying dynamic light scattering (DLS) as a powerful tool for monitoring and characterizing nanoparticle aggregation dynamics. We started by outlining the core ideas behind DLS and how it may be used to examine colloidal particle size distribution and aggregation dynamics; then, in the last section, we included the options to control aggregation in the chemically processed toner. In addition, we pinpointed knowledge gaps and difficulties that obstruct the use of DLS in real-world situations. Although widely used, DLS has limits when dealing with complicated systems, including combinations of nanoparticles, high concentrations, and non-spherical particles. We discussed these issues and offered possible solutions and the incorporation of supplementary characterization approaches. Finally, we emphasized how critical it is to close the gap between fundamental studies of nanoparticle aggregation and their translation into real-world applications, recognizing challenges in colloidal science.},

  abstract = {The common use of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) in portable devices and electric vehicles is promoting an exponential growth of the rechargeable batteries market. Their use in electric vehicles while not yet so common will be favored in the near future by government incentives aiming to mitigate global warming effects coming from combustion engines. Despite the remote risk of cobalt (Co) and lithium (Li) supplies running low, metals recovery from "postconsumer" scrap is a rapidly expanding topic in the political agenda within the context of the circular economy. Among other recycling technologies, processes using mild conditions and providing high recycling efficiencies are gaining increased interest. For instance, organic acids are particularly interesting for LiCoO2 dissolution even though they typically need the additional use of reducing agents. Herein, we explore the Co (and Li) recovery from spent LIBs using deep eutectic solvents (DESs) at temperatures as low as 90 {$^\circ$}C, at times of dissolution as short as 15 min and without the use of any additional reducing agent. In particular, we used the eutectic mixture composed of p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) monohydrate and choline chloride (ChCl) (e.g., PTSA{$\cdot$}H2O{$\cdot$}ChClDES with a 1:1:1 molar ratio) and aqueous dilutions thereof (e.g., PTSA{$\cdot$}2H2O{$\cdot$}ChClDES and PTSA{$\cdot$}3H2O{$\cdot$}ChClDES with 1:2:1 and 1:3:1 molar ratios, respectively). Compared to organic acids, PTSAChCl-based DESs offered a significant reduction of the solute to solvent ratio (in g/L) needed for full Co dissolution. This brings benefits both in economic and sustainable terms that handling low solvent volumes has in industrial processes. Interestingly, Co recovery efficiencies from spent LIBs reached figures of up to 94\% over the whole process relating to the extraction from spent LIBs using PTSAChCl-based DESs, the precipitation with either Na2CO3 or (NH4)2CO3, and the final calcination to obtain Co3O4},

  abstract = {Electrochemical capacitors (ECs) have only recently been considered as an alternative power source for telemetry sensors of drilling equipment for geothermal or oil and gas exploration. The lifecycle analysis and modelling of ECs is underrepresented in literature in comparison to other storage devices e.g. Li-ion batteries. This paper investigates the degradation of ECs when cycled outside the manufacturer-specified operating temperature envelope and proposes a machine learning-based approach for modelling the degradation. Experimental results show that end of life, defined as a 30\% decrease in capacitance, occurs at 1,000 cycles when the environmental temperature exceeds the maximum operating temperature by 30\%. The life-cycle test data is then used as an input to a Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithm to predict the capacitance fade trend. The GPR is validated on a total of nine commercial cells from two different manufacturers, achieving an average root mean squared percent error of less than 2\% and a mean calibration score of 93\% when referenced to a 95\% confidence interval. The model can be utilized to determine the EC degradation rate at a range of operating temperature values.},

The ionic conductivities of the gels were similar to those of the unmodified DESs,t hus provingt he deep eutectic nature of the ionic liquid-like phase.G elation was tolerant of ionic additives Li + ,M g 2+ ,a nd Ca 2+ ;t he resulting gels had similar conductivities to electrolyte dissolved in the native DES.T he low-molecular-weight gelator DBS is thus al ow-cost additive that forms gels in DESs from readily available constituents, with conductivity levels suitable for practical applications. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are as pecific class of ionic liquid first developed by Abbott and co-workers. [1] In contrast to traditional ionic liquids (ILs), which are composed of ad iscrete anion and cation, [2] DESs are typically formed by mixing aq uaternary ammonium salt with ah ydrogen-bond donor (or metal salt). [3] Theh ydrogen-bond donor interacts with the anion to generate alarger nonsymmetrical ion, hence decreasing the melting point-in this way,t wo components that individually are solids can mix to form aliquid-like phase. DESs are af ascinating example in which hydrogen-bond-mediated anion binding,ak ey theme in supramolecular chemistry, [4] leads to significant changes in the properties of the bulk material. Like traditional ionic liquids,m any DESs have low vapour pressure,low flammability,and awide liquid range,b ut they also have additional advantages,i ncluding ease of preparation and the use of relatively inexpensive, nontoxic components.T hese solvents are being extensively explored for aw ide range of uses,i ncluding metal processing , [5] organic synthesis/catalysis, [6] nanomaterials synthesis, [7] analytical chemistry, [8] biotechnology, [9] and energy applications. [10] There has previously been considerable interest in struc-turing traditional ILs into soft materials,s uch as gels,t o generate "ionogels". [11] Gels are well-known colloidal soft materials in which a" solid-like" network extends through a" liquid-like" phase,t hus leading to sample immobilisation. Thesolid-like network in gels is most commonly cross-linked or entangled polymers, [12] but can also be composed of small molecules (low-molecular-weight gelators,L MWGs) that self-assemble into an anoscale network as ar esult of intermolecular noncovalent interactions. [13] In 2001, in landmark research, Kimizuka and Nakashima discovered glyco-lipid LMWGs that assembled into bilayer membranes capable of immobilising ILs. [14] Hanabusa et al. then reported afamily of dipeptide gelators functionalised with abranched alkyl chain, which they described as specialist gelators for ILs, importantly noting that gel conductivities were similar to those of the native ILs. [15] Later studies with other LMWGs in ILs also indicated that electrochemical properties of the gels were similar to those of the ILs. [16] Such materials have been incorporated as gel electrolytes into devices such as solar cells. [17] Remarkably,although there has been considerable development of ionogels based on traditional ILs,g els based on deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have seen much less attention, with relatively few reports of the use of polymers or silicas to immobilise DESs. [18] Arecent study used silica-based materials to immobilise DESs;the resulting gels were referred to as "eutectogels" for the first time,and their application in Li/Li-ion batteries was demonstrated. [19] However,tothe best of our knowledge,t here are no reports of supramolecular gels formed in DESs by self-assembly.I ns ome cases,t wo-component "deep eutectic" systems have themselves been applied as supramolecular gelators by addition to traditional solvents [20]-but this is significantly different to developing supramolecular gelators that can be added to DESs,t hus immobilising them, as targeted in this study.Asnoted above, DESs have inherent noncovalent interactions within their structures,w hich may interfere with self-assembly of the LMWG into an anoscale network (or the LMWG may limit DES performance). Such processes urgently need investigation. We therefore targeted supramolecular gels based on DESs,r easoning that such materials could have very high value in, for example,e nergy applications.}

One core dimension of non-financial utility is emotional attachment. However, we know little about the role of emotional attachment in shaping the owners' divestment or reinvestment decisions in volatile, uncertain and ambiguous environments. Based on an in-depth case study of a displaced agricultural family that lost its business in Colombia, we investigate the role of family members' perceived emotional attachment and financial utility in shaping their strategic decisions. Our findings broaden the notion of emotional attachment to comprise the family, the former family business, and the land, identifying six utility patterns. These patterns capture combinations of perceived emotional attachment and financial utility. We label these patterns hybrid family, family control, family splitting, entrepreneurial family, family safety and accommodating family utility, and find that they play a crucial role in each family member's preference for divestment and/or reinvestment decisions. The experience of trauma influenced two utility patterns favoured by women. This article contributes to the family business literature by advancing our knowledge of utility combinations transcending generations and ownership statuses in their preferred divestment and reinvestment decisions.},

  abstract = {It is essential to investigate the physicochemical and thermal properties of choline chloride (ChCl)-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) with various hydrogen bond donor (HBD) functional groups, such as {$\alpha$}-hydroxy acid (lactic acid) or polyol (glycerol). It is important to consider how molar ratios impact these properties, as they may be altered for particular applications. This study aimed to examine the physicochemical and thermal properties of ChCl-based DESs with lactic acid (LA) or glycerol (Gly) at different molar ratios (1:2--1:10). The pH of ChCl:LA (0--1.0) is lower than that of ChCl:Gly (4.0--5.0) because of the hydrogen bonds between ChCl and LA. A higher amount of LA/Gly resulted in higher densities of ChCl:Gly (1.20--1.22 g cm-3) and ChCl:LA (1.16--1.19 g cm-3) due to the stronger hydrogen bonds and tighter packing of the molecules. The refractive index of ChCl:Gly (1.47--1.48) was higher than ChCl:LA (1.44--1.46), with a trend similar to density. The viscosities of ChCl:Gly (0.235--0.453 Pa s) and ChCl:LA (0.04--0.06 Pa s) increased with increasing LA/Gly molar ratio but decreased with temperature due to the high kinetic energy from heating, lowering the attractive forces between molecules. The activation energy for ChCl:LA (15.29--15.55 kJ mol-1) is greater than for ChCl:Gly (7.77--8.78 kJ mol-1), indicating that ChCl:LA has a greater viscosity-temperature dependence than ChCl:Gly. The DESs decomposition temperatures are 179.73--192.14 {$^\circ$}C for ChCl:LA and 189.69--197.41 {$^\circ$}C for ChCl:Gly. Freezing temperatures are correlated with the molecular weight of HBDs, with lower values causing a larger decrease in freezing temperatures. The interactions of polyols with anions were stronger than those of {$\alpha$}-hydroxy acids with anions. The variations in HBA to HBD molar ratios affected DESs properties, providing a fundamental understanding of the properties critical for their diverse applications.},

Here, we report a method for the selective recovery of cobalt from mixed LIBs electrode materials. The method relies on the application of a green deep eutectic solvent (DES) and yields an extraction of 90\% for cobalt and only 10\% for nickel. A solvent extraction procedure was optimized to recover cobalt as cobalt oxalate, which was employed to produce lithium cobalt oxide cathode material. This produced cathode material delivered a discharge capacity of 150 mAh g-1 and a capacity retention between 10 and 100 galvanostatic cycles of 83\%. Remarkably, the residual DES solution was reused delivering the same cobalt extraction attained using the fresh DES. Cobalt separation constitutes one of the major bottleneck during LIBs recycling, requiring costly and complex hydrometallurgical operations. The demonstrated selectivity of the implemented leaching method, along with the possibility to reuse the residual DES solution, paves the way to a green recycling alternative allowing for the reintroduction of strategic materials into the LIBs production chain.},

We provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of the most recent research in this topic. As a starting point, we introduce machine learning principles, algorithms, descriptors, and databases in materials science. We continue with the description of different machine learning approaches for the discovery of stable materials and the prediction of their crystal structure. Then we discuss research in numerous quantitative structure-property relationships and various approaches for the replacement of first-principle methods by machine learning. We review how active learning and surrogate-based optimization can be applied to improve the rational design process and related examples of applications. Two major questions are always the interpretability of and the physical understanding gained from machine learning models. We consider therefore the different facets of interpretability and their importance in materials science.

We validate this method by performing Raman, WAXS and EPR measurements of series of resin and pitch-based carbons synthesized. The crystallite sizes of the WAXS analysis for the individual samples are related to corresponding positions and linewidths of G and D Raman modes and show excellent agreement between experiment and modelling from large sizes down to 4 nm. The theoretical master curves are independent of the precursor used in the synthesis, in contrast to models for the intensity ratio of D and G band versus size. We show that the latter are not universally valid and differ for each class of precursors. For sizes below 4 nm, our lineshape model fails as it is based on the bandstructure and phonon dispersions of ideal graphene. Thus, 4 nm corresponds to the fundamental transition from molecular to crystalline character for non-graphitic carbons.},

We have performed broadband dielectric spectroscopy on three such systems, covering a broad temperature and dynamic range that extends from the low-viscosity liquid around room temperature down to the glassy state approaching the glass-transition temperature. We detect a relaxational process that can be ascribed to dipolar reorientational dynamics and exhibits the clear signatures of glassy freezing. We find that the temperature dependence of the ionic dc conductivity and its room-temperature value also are governed by the glassy dynamics of these systems, depending, e.g., on the glass-transition temperature and fragility. Compared to the previously investigated corresponding systems, containing choline chloride instead of a lithium salt, both the reorientational and ionic dynamics are significantly reduced due to variations in the glass-transition temperature and the higher ionic potential of the lithium ions. These lithium-based deep eutectic solvents partly exhibit significant decoupling of the dipolar reorientational and the ionic translational dynamics and approximately follow a fractional Debye-Stokes-Einstein relation, leading to an enhancement of the dc conductivity, especially at low temperatures. The presented results clearly reveal the importance of decoupling effects and of the typical glass-forming properties of these systems for the technically relevant room-temperature conductivity.},

A wide range of materials is used as electrodes for SC applications because the electrochemical efficiency is primarily determined by the electrode materials used. Carbonaceous materials with unique surface, chemical, electrochemical, and electronic characteristics have become attractive for energy storage research, but they cannot meet the rising need for high specific energy and specific power. Besides, heteroatom-doped carbon materials have shown pseudocapacitance characteristics and improved specific energy, specific power, and conductivity. This makes them more adaptable in SC application. Among different heteroatom doping of carbon, S-doped carbon has gained considerable attention in SC applications due to its unpaired electrons and easily polarizable nature. S-doped carbon materials-based SCs have demonstrated enhanced surface wettability, improved conductivity, and induced pseudocapacitance effect, thereby delivering improved specific energy and specific power. Many reports on S-doped carbon for SC applications have been published, but there is no specific Review on the preparation of S-doped carbon for SC applications. This Review focuses on recent developments in the field of SC electrodes made from S-doped carbon materials. Herein, the preparation methods and applications of S-doped carbon for SCs were summarized following a brief discussion of different electrochemical characterization techniques of SCs. Finally, the challenges of S-doped carbon materials and their potential prospects were discussed to give crucial insights into the favorable factors for future innovations of SC electrodes. This Review aims to provide insight for further research on the preparation of S-doped carbon for electrochemical energy storage applications.},

  abstract = {Increasing applications of ionic liquids and their analogues, namely Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs), requires further investigation into the effect of moisture content on the physico-chemical characteristics of these fluids. Although it is common practice to synthesize these fluids in a moisture-controlled environment, as moisture is generally considered to have an impact on their properties, there are no systematic studies on this. We herein examine the effects of water on Reline, a Type-III DES composed of urea and choline chloride. Experiments were performed to obtain the physical properties of aqueous Reline solution. We observed moderate changes in density, speed of sound, refractive index, and pH with increasing water fraction; however, the change in viscosity and conductivity was strong and exponential. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the intermolecular interactions of Reline and aqueous Reline solutions. The simulations primarily present the significance of urea-anion interaction to explain the low melting point of the DES. In the presence of water, the anion is preferentially hydrated as compared to urea or the cation. More interestingly, simulations help to classify the effects of water into different regimes. At low water fractions ({$<$}5\%) the urea-urea interactions are enhanced, as is revealed through the hydrogen bond analysis. Beyond 25\% water fractions, the components of Reline are individually hydrated and have high diffusivity, which is further reflected in the change in transport properties. The results presented herein provide valuable information on aqueous Reline solutions both in terms of experimental data and molecular insights, which in turn, we believe, might assist in developing further applications of Reline and other related DESs. \copyright{} the Partner Organisations 2014.}

The pyrolytic oil was tested for its fuel value and compared with the Indian Standards (Bharat Stage 1--6). It was tested for different value-added compounds using GCMS and determining the functional groups using FTIR and NMR for commercial applications. Detailed analysis of rCB was carried out using different analytical techniques like BET, XRD and particle size distribution so as to understand the physical nature of synthesized rCB. Addition of tyre rCB was found to have increase in tensile strength and associated properties of vulcanization of rubber product without any negative impact. Significant improvement was observed on tear strength properties while adding the rCB compared to that of without rCB addition or addition of carbon black.

The datasets are analyzed using classification and regression trees to gain electrochemical insights. The feature importance analysis revealed that the working electrode's material composition, substrate, electrolyte, counter electrode, etching time, etchant, fabrication technique, potential window, and current density are the most influential parameters governing the SC performance. Moreover, different ML algorithms such as random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), gradient boosting (GB), and linear model (LM) are utilized to predict the specific capacitance, cyclic stability, and capacitive retention of MXene-based SCs. Among them, RF showed the highest predictive accuracy (Pearson's r {$\approx$}\textasciitilde 0.94, Adj.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}During thermal runaway (TR), lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) produce a large amount of gas, which can cause unimaginable disasters in electric vehicles and electrochemical energy storage systems when the batteries fail and subsequently combust or explode. Therefore, to systematically analyze the post-thermal runaway characteristics of commonly used LIBs with LiFePO4 (LFP) and LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) cathode materials and to maximize the in situ gas generation during battery thermal runaway, we designed experiments using an adiabatic explosion chamber (AEC) under an inert atmosphere to test LIBs. Additionally, we conducted in situ analysis of the gas components produced during thermal runaway. Our research findings indicate that after thermal runaway, NCM batteries produce more gas than LFP batteries. Based on battery gas production, the degree of harm caused by TR can be ranked as follows: NCM9 0.5 0.5 \&gt; NCM811 \&gt; NCM622 \&gt; NCM523 \&gt; LFP. The primary gas components during thermal runaway for both NCM and LFP batteries include H2,CO,CO2,C2H4, and CH4. The gas produced by LFP batteries contains a high proportion of H2. The high concentration of H2 results in a lower flammability limit (LFL) for the gas generated by LFP batteries during TR compared to the mixed gas produced by NCM batteries. Therefore, in terms of battery TR gas composition, the order of hazard level is LFP \&gt; NCM811 \&gt; NCM622 \&gt; NCM523 \&gt; NCM9 0.5 0.5 0.5. Although experimental results show that LFP batteries have superior thermal stability and lower gas production during large-scale battery thermal runaway events, considering gas generation composition and thermal runaway products, the thermal runaway risk of LFP batteries may be higher than that of NCM batteries. Although LFP batteries are considered very safe, our research results have once again drawn researchers' attention to LFP batteries. These gases can also serve as detection signals for battery thermal runaway warnings, providing a cautionary note for the future development of electrochemical energy storage and the renewable energy sector.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, for the first time the ambient-pressure relithiation of degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) cathodes via eutectic Li+ molten-salt solutions is successfully demonstrated. Combining such a low-temperature relithiation process with a well-designed thermal annealing step, NCM523 cathode particles with significant Li loss ({$\approx$}40\%) and capacity degradation ({$\approx$}50\%) can be successfully regenerated to achieve their original composition and crystal structures, leading to effective recovery of their capacity, cycling stability, and rate capability to the levels of the pristine materials. Advanced characterization tools including atomic resolution electron microscopy imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy are combined to demonstrate that NCM523's original layered crystal structure is recovered. For the first time, it is shown that layer-to-rock salt phase change on the surfaces and subsurfaces of the cathode materials can be reversed if lithium can be incorporated back to the material. The result suggests the great promise of using eutectic Li+ molten--salt solutions for ambient-pressure relithiation to recycle and remanufacture degraded LIB cathode materials.},

Carbon-based materials are seen as a promising and viable way to overcome these challenges. They have a very high thermal conductivity and can hold liquid phase change materials (PCMs) in their pores. This review provides comprehensive coverage of the carbon structures and their classifications, including carbon nanotubes (CNT), carbon nanofiber (CNF), expanded graphite (EG), graphene, graphene oxide (GO), carbonized industrial solid wastes, and other carbon-based materials that can be used as supporting porous materials in developing FS-OPCMs for thermal energy storage (TES) applications. In addition, the thermal and chemical performance of carbon-based FS-OPCMs is extensively investigated and given. The applications of such composites are also discussed and summarized. Finally, the potential of these materials for thermal energy storage is presented.

The present review aims to open up a new avenue to guide the readers to quickly obtain in-depth knowledge of applications of hierarchically porous materials and to have a good idea about selecting and designing suitable hierarchically porous materials for a specific application. In addition to focusing on the applications of hierarchically porous materials, this comprehensive review could stimulate researchers to synthesize new advanced hierarchically porous solids.},

Presence of H2O as impurity adds newer characteristics to voltammetric and impedance responses of the melt, as a result of faradaic processes involving formation of OH- and O2- in potential region -0.40 to -2.30 V as well as non-faradaic process involving adsorption of OH- at around -1.25 V. Present work was focussed on characterization of moisture containing LiCl-KCl eutectic melts using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. LiCl-KCl eutectic melts thermally equilibrated with different amounts of H2O at 500 {$^\circ$}C were further analysed for residual moisture content by acid-base titration method developed as part of this experimental work. Complex impedance response of different LiCl-KCl eutectic melts at inert tungsten electrode was recorded in potential range -0.50 to -2.50 V to explore contributions of various faradaic and non-faradaic processes due to secondary impurities formed as a result of H2O as primary impurity in the melt. Equivalent circuit models were selected to fit complex impedance data of different melts. Validation of impedance data was also performed by Kramers-Kronig transforms in which pseudo-{$\chi$}2 values in range 10-6 to 10-4 were obtained.},

The use of carbonized banana peel (CBP) with PEDOT-PSS to develop reliable and sustainable supercapacitors was investigated. The work includes the design of a CBP: PEDOT-PSS axisymmetric electrode energy storage device with 0.1 M K2SO4 electrolyte. The results showed that the screen-printed cotton fabric delivered an electrical conductivity of 4.1 \textpm{} 1.3 S/cm and a specific capacitance, and energy density of 52.1 F g-1 and 7.233 WhKg-1 at 5 mV/s scanning rate, respectively with a three-electrode system. The material showed a remarkable rate performance in an axisymmetric three-electrode cell configuration with an operating potential window of 0--0.5 V. In addition, the fabricated material demonstrated uniform deposition of PEDOT-PSS and CBP on the cotton fabric which was confirmed by both AFM and SEM image analysis. FTIR confirmed the structural properties of the composite. There is more consistency between the ideal supercapacitor modelled with COMSOL Multiphysics and the actual experimental results. The model curves aid in better design and performance and durability monitoring by offering a more thorough and precise characterization of the kinetics and thermodynamics of the supercapacitors. Consequently, the CBP: PEDOT-PSS composite presents a promising option for supercapacitor uses.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, energy supply chains have been entangled with many factors (e.g., overconsumption, depletion of fossil fuels, and contamination of natural resources). Besides, many efforts have been made to discern different sources of renewable energy (e.g., photovoltaic solar energy, biomass energy, and various metals for energy storage). Among the metals, lithium has been more used in different industries, particularly the lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), due to their very high reactivity and lightweight. LIBs are energy storage systems containing an electrolyte, anode, cathode, current collector, and separator. The cathode is characterized as the most significant part of LIBs since it has a significant impact on the main features of the battery (e.g., power, energy density, and lifetime). In this study, the evaluation of cathode materials is investigated based on a set of economic, environmental, and tactical criteria in three main phases. In the first phase, a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) based on subjective, objective, and combined weights including SAW-AHP, SAW-CILOS, SAW-AHP-CILOS, TOPSIS-AHP, TOPSIS-CILOS, TOPSIS-AHP-CILOS, CoCoSo-AHP, CoCoSo-CILOS, CoCoSo-AHP-CILOS, MARCOS-AHP, MARCOS-CILOS, and MARCOS-AHP-CILOS methods is developed and the performance of cathode materials is evaluated based on the final ranking of alternatives (FRA) and Copeland methodologies. In the second phase, using the efficient and anti-efficient frontiers determined by the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, the performance of cathode materials is evaluated. In the third phase, the performance of the three proposed methodologies is compared. The results of this study demonstrate that the hybrid MCDM-FRA methodology is more flexible than the modified DEA model and hybrid MCDM-Copeland method to address the sustainable cathode material selection problem.},

STAC-XRD is more appropriate for analyzing coal with low crystallinity than the classical XRD analysis method by using the interlayer spacing of aromatic layers (d002) and the mean crystallite size along the c axis (Lc). STAC-XRD was also used to compare the development of the stacking structure in caking coal during heat treatment with that in non-caking coal. After heat treatment at 920{$^\circ$}C, Nave of the caking coals was larger than that of the non-caking coals. The stacking of the aromatic layers in the caking coal temporarily developed at the fluidity stage at 400--440{$^\circ$}C, but in the 440--600{$^\circ$}C range, the release of volatile components partially disordered the stacked layers. The influence of heat-treatment conditions on carbon stacking structure in several kinds of coal was investigated by means of STAC-XRD. The heating rate required for the development of stacking structure in lower-rank coals was slower than that required for higher-rank coals.},

The as-prepared DESs possessed strong coordination ability and low viscosity, which were suitable for metal extraction. The influences of experiment parameters on extraction of Co and Li were systematically investigated, and the leaching mechanism and kinetics were elucidated in detail. Under the optimal conditions, the leaching efficiencies of Co and Li from pure LiCoO2 reached 93.5\% and 98.3\%, while those of Co, Ni, Mn, and Li achieved 94.8\%, 99.1\%, 100\%, and 100\% from the spent Li14.8Ni1.7Co8.5MnO30.5, respectively. Results revealed that the Li+ ions located in the interlayer of layered LiCoO2 were replaced by H+ ions and entered into solution, while Co3+ ions in the skeleton structure were reduced and coordinated by EG and sulfosalicylic acid (SA) to form four soluble Co2+-SA complexes, realizing synergistic and efficient leaching of Li and Co from the LIB cathode active material. Moreover, Co and Li leaching kinetics conformed to the shrinking core model, in which the interfacial chemical reaction was the limiting step, and the apparent activation energies were separately about 77.38 and 79.54 kJ/mol.},

The existing process has basically realized the extraction of cobalt, but there are still shortcomings in harmless disposal of fluorine-containing electrolyte, binder and other organic matters, selective extraction of lithium and low-cost extraction of cobalt. In this context, a novel process was developed to realize the full-component recovery of spent LiCoO2 battery via environmentally friendly pyrolysis and hydrometallurgical leaching. The organic matters were recovered in the form of pyrolytic oil and gas, in which the harmful fluorine element was absorbed by Ca(OH)2 solution. The current collectors (copper and aluminum) were recovered after the easy separation of electrode materials due to the degradation of binders. During pyrolysis the cathode material was deconstructed and reduced under the synergistic effect of pyrolytic gas and anode graphite. Selective recovery of lithium and cobalt was achieved through carbonated water leaching and reductant-free acid leaching. The leaching efficiencies of lithium and cobalt were respectively 87.9\% and 99.1\% under the optimal conditions. Lithium carbonate and cobalt sulfate were obtained by evaporative crystallization, respectively. The remaining residue was only graphite without impurity entrainment. The results in this research suggest that the process consisting of pyrolysis and hydrometallurgical leaching is inexpensive, efficient, and eco-friendly for full-component recycling of spent LiCoO2 battery.},

  abstract = {Recycling is always seen as an end-of-pipe process returning as much material as possible into a circular economy. There is a growing school of thought that suggests product design should be an important step in the recycling process. While this review is aimed specifically at one technological product, it contains facets that are applicable to the recycling of any complex product. Decarbonisation of energy production necessitates a proliferation of efficient electrical storage and a significant proportion of this, particularly in automotive propulsion, will use lithium ion batteries. The scale of the projected electric vehicle market means that a circular economy model needs to be established while the scale of end-of-life product is still manageable to prevent a build-up of hazardous waste. This critical review investigates the issues of lithium ion battery recycling and discusses the aspects of pack, module and cell design that can simplify battery dismantling and recycling. It highlights not only Green aspects of elemental recovery, but also technoeconomic features which may govern the appropriate direction for recycling. It also shows that as cell design changes, the approach to recycling can become more efficient.}

A retro-economic analysis shows the theoretical cost of reprocessing for a hypothetical \$100 / kWh battery. Ten different hydrometallurgical approaches to LIB recycling are contrasted through techno-economic analysis of the wet part of the process. We show that shredded material can be recycled into new cathode material with a cost saving of up to 20\%. Comparable processes using disassembled cells enable up to 80\% cost saving (not accounting for the actual step of disassembling the cell). In the light of these results, we set out the barriers to disassembly of LIB cells, recommending the importance of design for disassembly as key to improving the circularity of LIB supply chains, ensuring that greater value is retained within the system.},

Rate\&nbsp;performance is related to the timescales associated with charge/ionic motion in both electrode and electrolyte. However, no general fittable model exists to link capacity-rate data to electrode/electrolyte properties. Here we demonstrate an equation which can fit capacity versus rate data, outputting three parameters which fully describe rate\&nbsp;performance. Most important is the characteristic time associated with charge/discharge which can be linked by a second equation to physical electrode/electrolyte parameters via various rate-limiting processes. We fit these equations to \textasciitilde 200 data sets, deriving parameters such as diffusion coefficients or electrolyte conductivities. It is possible to show which rate-limiting processes are dominant in a given situation, facilitating rational design and cell optimisation. In addition, this model predicts the upper speed limit for lithium/sodium ion batteries, yielding a value that is consistent with the fastest electrodes in the literature. The authors employ a semi-empirical method to fit published battery capacity-rate data to extract the characteristic time associated with charge/discharge. These characteristic times are consistent with a physical model that can be used to link rate\&nbsp;performance to the physical properties of electrodes.},

While increasing numbers of car manufacturers are introducing electrified models into their offering, range anxiety and the length of time required to recharge the batteries are still a common concern. The high currents needed to accelerate the charging process have been known to reduce energy efficiency and cause accelerated capacity and power fade. Fast charging is a multiscale problem, therefore insights from atomic to system level are required to understand and improve fast charging performance. The present paper reviews the literature on the physical phenomena that limit battery charging speeds, the degradation mechanisms that commonly result from charging at high currents, and the approaches that have been proposed to address these issues. Special attention is paid to low temperature charging. Alternative fast charging protocols are presented and critically assessed. Safety implications are explored, including the potential influence of fast charging on thermal runaway characteristics. Finally, knowledge gaps are identified and recommendations are made for the direction of future research. The need to develop reliable onboard methods to detect lithium plating and mechanical degradation is highlighted. Robust model-based charging optimisation strategies are identified as key to enabling fast charging in all conditions. Thermal management strategies to both cool batteries during charging and preheat them in cold weather are acknowledged as critical, with a particular focus on techniques capable of achieving high speeds and good temperature homogeneities.},

  abstract = {The microstructure of carbon blacks is investigated by X-ray diffraction peak profile analysis. Strain anisotropy is accounted for by the dislocation model of the mean square strain in terms of average dislocation contrast factors. Crystallite shape anisotropy is modeled by ellipsoids incorporated into the size profile function. Different grades of carbon blacks, N990, N774 and N134, untreated, heat-treated and compressed at 2.5 GPa have been investigated. The microstructure is characterized in terms of crystallite size-distribution, dislocation density and crystallite shape anisotropy. Heat treatment results in increased vertical and lateral sizes of graphitic crystallites. Postproduction pressure treatment has little effect on the average sizes of the crystallites, however, it affects the crystallite size distribution function. The average sizes of the crystallites obtained by X-ray diffraction agree with those estimated from Raman spectra. Applied pressure affects the magnitude of strain within the crystallites.},

Furthermore, their distinctive qualities, such as novel structure, narrow size distribution, low resistivity, high surface accessible area, and high stability, both MWCNTs (multi-walled CNTs) and SWCNTs (single-walled CNTs) have been taken into consideration for electrochemical material in supercapacitor application. The EDLC mechanism is primarily responsible for the high specific capacitance value of CNTs. As a result, the physical characteristics of CNTs, like their surface area and electrical conductivity, that are associated with their fabrication and post-synthesis processes, primarily determine their supercapacitive performance.

Recycling LiCoO2 cathodes can provide a secondary source for these critical metals, which are necessary raw materials for the synthesis of modern LiB cathodes, such as nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC). In this work, an environmentally friendly, closed-loop process for recovery and separation of lithium and cobalt from LiCoO2 cathodes has been developed using oxalate chemistry. In this paper, oxalic acid and ammonium hydrogen oxalate are utilized as digestion reagents to extract lithium into the aqueous phase (Li2C2O4) and precipitate cobalt oxalate (CoC2O4{$\cdot$}2H2O) in the solid phase resulting in a low-temperature, cost-effective separation of these metals. A green-colored intermediate was identified as a Co(III)-oxalate complex; this complex further reduces and precipitates as a Co(II)-oxalate complex (CoC2O4{$\cdot$}2H2O). The optimum acidity for digestion and metals separation using oxalate containing acids was a pH {$<$} 2.5. The minimum amount of oxalic acid required for digestion was determined in order to develop the most economical process with more than 97 wt \% Li and Co recovery. The proposed process is an energy-efficient, cost-effective, environmentally friendly process for recovering high-value, critical metals, such as lithium and cobalt from LiBs and other sources.},

This work unveiled the roles of the substrates, applied potentials, and operating temperatures on the performance of cobalt electrochemical recovery in a deep eutectic choline chloride+urea solvent. The solvent contains cobalt and lithium ions extracted from lithium cobalt oxides -- 3an essential lithium-ion battery cathode material. Our results highlight that the substrate predetermines the cobalt recovery modes via substrate--cobalt interactions, which could be predicted by the cobalt surface segregation energies and crystallographic misfits. We also show that a moderate cathode potential under -1.0 V vs. silver quasi-reference electrode at 94--104 {$^\circ$}C is essential to ensure a selective cobalt recovery at an optimal rate. We also found that the stainless-steel mesh is an optimal substrate for cobalt recovery due to its relatively high selectivity, fast recovery rate, and easy cobalt collection. Our work provides new insights on metal recovery in deep eutectic solvents and offers a new avenue to control the metal electrodeposition modes via modulation of substrate compositions and crystal structures.},

The kinetic experiments indicated that the leaching process fitted well to the shrinking core model controlled by chemical reactions. The value metals could be extracted with high efficiencies by adjusting the operating parameters in the step of coextraction. Moreover, the electrochemical tests of the regenerated ternary material revealed that the material had an excellent electrochemical performance.

Mechanism analysis results confirm that the separation of Al foil and cathode materials was the result of the deactivation of the organic binder polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which can be attributed to an alkali degradation process caused by the attack of the hydroxide of choline chloride on the acidic hydrogen atom in PVDF.},

However, due to the weak reducing power of DESs, raising the temperature and extending the duration of processing are not efficient for screening suitable DESs for the recycling of LIBs. Here, we propose a novel, simple and robust experimental method to identify suitable DESs for recycling spent LIBs. Based on electrochemical principles, the method proposed in this study can be used to quickly determine the reducing power of DESs. As an example, a choline chloride (ChCl) and urea mixture as a DES was found to possess strong reducing power, with a Li and Co extraction efficiency of 95\% from spent LIBs obtained at a reduced reaction temperature of 180 {$^\circ$}C and reaction time of 12 h. The results are in good agreement with the results from Fukui functions calculations. The kinetic experiments revealed that the Li and Co extraction is controlled by solution and electron diffusion through the DES. Furthermore, a cubic cobalt oxide spinel (Co3O4) was obtained from the loaded DES using H2C2O4 and NaOH in the dilution-precipitation-calcination process. The current strategy demonstrates great potential for rapid and reliable screening of suitable DESs for the effective recycling of spent LIBs.}

It is therefore essential to develop a sustainable closed-loop recycling technology (reduction-ammoniacal method) for spent LIBs. In this study, the effects of various species of ammonia, ammonium salts and reductants on the leaching of Li, Co, Ni, Mn and Al from spent LIBs were investigated with a hydrothermal method. An increase of the electrode potential of the reductant greatly accelerated the selective leaching of Li, Co and Ni, which agreed with the thermodynamic analysis results. The standard electrode potentials of the LiNixCoyMn1-x-yO2 (NCM) materials were also determined by using approximate calculations. When using (NH4)2SO3 as a reductant in a one-step leaching process, 100\% Co, 98.3\% Ni and 90.3\% Li were extracted into the ammonia-ammonium chloride solutions. From the kinetics analysis, the surface chemical reaction shrinking core model was found to control the leaching behavior of Li, Co, and Ni in the reduction-ammoniacal leaching process. A shell-core structure was composed of a product layer, a diffusion layer of the solid core and an unreacted core. Species in the product layer reduced the leaching efficiencies of Li, Co, and Ni. The results obtained for this hydrothermal reduction-ammoniacal method applied to recycle spent LIBs provide insights for the design of a high-speed, exceptionally selective, closed-loop recycling technique.},

Carbons with lower graphitization degree (IG/ID value) usually possess many defects and poor electrical conductivities. Carbon materials with high graphitization degree always possess less contact sites. Both two carbon materials are conducive to achieve sulfur loads. However, sulfur-loading capacities of two materials are different. In this paper, two carbon materials with different graphitization degrees are combined to form composite carbon materials. Studies show that composite carbon electrodes with suitable IG/ID values possess good sulfur-loading capacities (80\%) because of high conductivity and defect contents. Two kinds of C-S bonds are produced after loading sulfur and both of them are conducive to stable production of polysulfides. One C-S bond is conducive to diffusion of lithium ions on electrode surface and the other C-S bond is conducive to rapid conversion of polysulfides. Under the performance of two C-S bonds, high capacity storage and good cycling stability can be achieved by electrodes under high sulfur-loading conditions.},

Particular attention is paid to the material design of MXene-based adsorbents, such as interlayer regulation, surface modification, and chemical conversion. Various interaction mechanisms between these pollutants and MXenes, including ion exchange, inner-sphere coordination, and reduction immobilization, are summarized and clarified.

In this article, various application of ILs are reviewed by focusing on their use as electrolyte materials for Li/Na ion batteries, Li-sulfur batteries, Li-oxygen batteries, and nonhumidified fuel cells and as carbon precursors for electrode catalysts of fuel cells and electrode materials for batteries and supercapacitors. Due to their characteristic properties such as nonvolatility, high thermal stability, and high ionic conductivity, ILs appear to meet the rigorous demands/criteria of these various applications. However, for further development, specific applications for which these characteristic properties become unique (i.e., not easily achieved by other materials) must be explored. Thus, through strong demands for research and consideration of ILs unique properties, we will be able to identify indispensable applications for ILs.},

For the real application of supercapacitors, there is no doubt that cyclic stability is the most important aspect. As the core component, electrode materials determine the cyclic stability of supercapacitors, although the other components like electrolyte and separator are also important. In this review, we sum up the cyclic stability of supercapacitors according to type of electrode material and its energy storage mechanism, discuss the strategies to boost the stability of those electrode materials, and indicate several key significant considerations in measurement of cyclic stability. The purpose is to obtain safe, long-lasting, and high-performance supercapacitor devices.}

In this work, the Li1-xNaxCoO2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.03, and 0.05) cathode materials with structural repair and electrochemical performance improvement were obtained from degraded LiCoO2 cathodes (Li loss of {$>$}50\% and capacity reduction of about 65\%) in combination with relithiation regeneration and modification. Compared with regenerated LiCoO2 (RLCO) and commercial LiCoO2 (CLCO) materials, the Li1-xNaxCoO2 cathodes show a neat and ordered layered structure, better discharge capacity, and cycle stability, especially at high current density and high voltage. The initial discharge capacities of Li0.99Na0.01CoO2 (NLCO0.01) and RLCO are 151.5 and 149.4 mA h g-1 at the rate of 1C, respectively, which is almost three times higher than that of degraded LiCoO2 (50.5 mA h g-1). Moreover, the capacity retention rate after 100 cycles of NLCO0.01 at the rate of 10C is as high as 87.6\%, vastly superior to the 63.2 and 54.2\% retention rates of RLCO and CLCO, respectively. The excellent rate performance and cycle ability are attributed to the expansion of lithium layer spacing caused by sodium-ion doping with a larger radius and faster Li+ diffusion kinetics in the NLCO0.01 sample. This work provides a simple and effective strategy to regenerate and modify spent cathode materials, which provides a reference for the disposal of spent LIBs henceforth.},

Making use of the gradual generation of copper ions from the Cu anode and continuous migration to the cathode, a Cu2+-crosslinked sodium alginate (SA)-based hydrogel was obtained with both crosslinking density gradient and SA distribution gradient. The gradient structure can be conveniently adjusted to achieve excellent mechanical properties and delicate patterning. The electrolysis-electrophoresis method is successfully extended to versatile hydrogels by varying different metal electrodes (Fe or Zn electrodes), or different types of polysaccharides (chitosan or sodium carboxymethyl cellulose).

However, how to realize resource circulation of critical metals including lithium (Li) and cobalt (Co) becomes the new problem of LIBs industry. This paper proposes an improved thermal reduction technology to efficiently recycle Li and Co from spent LIBs, where cheap urea is applied as the only additive to provide ammonia (NH3). By thermal reduction, LiCoO2 was thermally reduced into water-soluble lithium carbonate and water-insoluble cobalt metal Under the optimal conditions, 99.96\% Li with nearly 100\% selectivity was obtained by water leaching. More importantly, the concept of ``oxygen elements removal (OER)'' was proposed to explain the metal extraction from spent LIBs, which could help to describe the reaction mechanism as O-cage digestion mechanism. Furthermore, metal extraction from spent LIBs was re-understood as ``seeking an applicable reductant'', which provided a fresh perspective for understanding Li selective recovery. These concepts and findings can provide some inspiration for metal recovery from spent LIBs.},

Recycling lithium resource from spent lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is significant for lithium deficiency and environmental protection. A novel approach for recycling lithium element as Li2CO3 from spent LIBs is proposed. First, the electrode materials preobtained by mechanical separation are pyrolyzed under enclosed vacuum condition. During this process the Li is released as Li2CO3 from the crystal structure of lithium transition metal oxides due to the collapse of the oxygen framework. An optimal Li recovery rate of 81.90\% is achieved at 973 K for 30 min with a solid-to-liquid ratio of 25 g L-1, and the purity rate of Li2CO3 is 99.7\%. The collapsed mechanism is then presented to explain the release of lithium element during the vacuum pyrolysis. Three types of spent LIBs including LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, and LiCoxMnyNizO2 are processed to prove the validity of in situ recycling Li2CO3 from spent LIBs under enclosed vacuum condition. Finally, an economic assessment is taken to prove that this recycling process is positive.},

Current water electrolysis technologies developed for the green hydrogen production require high voltage values of around 2.0 V, making them uneconomical for large-scale applications. The voltage required for the production of hydrogen can be substantially reduced to around 1.0 V by performing the electrolysis at high temperatures. This article concerns the low-cost and green electrolytic production of hydrogen operating at such a low voltage performed by the dissolution of steam in high temperature molten salt electrolytes, and the subsequent electrochemical reduction of the dissolved hydrogen ions. The electro-generation of hydrogen is confirmed by performing cyclic voltammetry using molten lithium chloride as the electrolyte at 660 {$^\circ$}C under a flow of moisturized argon. Furthermore, hydrogen is generated by the electrolysis of molten salt containing hydrogen ions using a nickel foam cathode at the constant cell voltage of 1.5 V with a high Faradaic efficiency of 83.2\%. The results obtained provide crucial insights for further development of molten salt technologies for clean and efficient hydrogen production.},

The DESs electrolytes represent good electrochemical performance and the maximum specific capacitance reaches 217 F g-1 and the energy density is 18.42 Wh kg-1 at 0.7 kW kg-1. It is noteworthy that the DESs electrolytes can produce pseudocapacitance. Consequently, the total pseudocapacitance of supercapacitors is contributed by the redox reaction of KI as well as the redox reaction of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of activated carbon. Meanwhile, iodine-related ions and unbonded hydroxyl group of DESs electrolytes form hydrogen bonds with the oxygen-containing functional groups, accelerating the migration of electrolytes ions. Additionally, it is found that the internal composition of DESs electrolytes plays a vital effect on its properties. Resultantly, DESs with a molar ratio of KI to EG of 1:7 delivers the highest conductivity (1.22 mS cm-1) and the lowest viscosity (39.77 cP), exhibiting best electrochemical performance.

Specifically, the effects of regenerative processing parameters on the composition, structure, and electrochemical performance of the regenerated cathode materials are investigated via systematic characterization and testing. From this analysis, it was found that the raw material costs can be substantially reduced by either replacing the typically employed 4 M LiOH solution by a cost-effective mixture of 0.1 M LiOH and 3.9 M KOH or recycling of the concentrated 4 M LiOH for continuous relithiation processes. Life cycle analysis suggests that this strategy results in reduced energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, leading to an increased potential revenue, particularly when compared with hydro- and pyrometallurgical recycling methods.},

  abstract = {Recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is an urgent need to address their environmental and global sustainability issues. Here, we report an efficient and environmentally benign LIB regeneration method based on defect-targeted healing, which represents a paradigm-shift LIB recycling strategy. Specifically, by combining low-temperature aqueous solution relithiation and rapid post-annealing, we demonstrate successful direct regeneration of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes, one of the most important materials for EVs and grid storage applications. We show revitalization of composition, structure, and electrochemical performance of LFP with various degradation conditions to the same levels as the pristine LFP. Life-cycle analysis of different LIB recycling processes shows that this defect-targeted direct reycling approach can significantly reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, leading to more economic and environmental benefits compared with today's hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical methods. The consumption of lithium-ion batteries is experiencing booming growth in the modern industry due to their widespread applications. With billions of batteries reaching their lifetime soon, significant concerns on the economic and environmental issues have been raised about how to treat these spent batteries so that our society will not face similar crisis incurred in the case of plastic wastes. However, traditional technologies used in today's recycling industry are limited to recovering expensive metals through energy-intensive processes, which cause significant greenhouse gas emissions and secondary wastes, posing additional environmental concerns. To tackle this challenge, we developed a safe, low-cost, and efficient direct recycling approach that is based on targeted healing. This paradigm-shift method leverages our understanding on phase and structure evaluations of the LIB cathode and produces ready-to-use recycled cathode materials that match the electrochemical performance of pristine materials. A paradigm-shift lithium-ion battery recycling method based on defect-targeted healing can fully recover the composition, structure, and electrochemical performance of spent LiFePO4 cathodes with various degradation conditions to the same levels as that of the pristine materials. Such a direct recycling approach can significantly reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions, leading to significant economic and environmental benefits compared with today's hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgic methods.

Here, we quantify the future demand for key battery materials, considering potential electric vehicle fleet and battery chemistry developments as well as second-use and recycling of electric vehicle batteries. We find that in a lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide dominated battery scenario, demand is estimated to increase by factors of 18--20 for lithium, 17--19 for cobalt, 28--31 for nickel, and 15--20 for most other materials from 2020 to 2050, requiring a drastic expansion of lithium, cobalt, and nickel supply chains and likely additional resource discovery. However, uncertainties are large. Key factors are the development of the electric vehicles fleet and battery capacity requirements per vehicle. If other battery chemistries were used at large scale, e.g. lithium iron phosphate or novel lithium-sulphur or lithium-air batteries, the demand for cobalt and nickel would be substantially smaller. Closed-loop recycling plays a minor, but increasingly important role for reducing primary material demand until 2050, however, advances in recycling are necessary to economically recover battery-grade materials from end-of-life batteries. Second-use of electric vehicles batteries further delays recycling potentials.}

Excess molar volumes of the aqueous mixtures of glyceline are found to be negative and significant at all temperatures and compositions. Absolute excess molar volume is found to decrease as the temperature is increased from 283.15. K to 323.15. K. For temperature above 323.15.

The results showed that the samples by steam activation (AC-H2O) had higher SBET, pore volume and surface oxygen-containing functional groups than those by CO2 activation (AC-CO2). Different kinds of pyrolusite had influence on the pore structures and the contents of C--O/C=O groups on the AC-H2O samples, due to different contents of Mn/Fe in these pyrolusite. All pyrolusite modified samples demonstrated a higher desulfurization activity than blank ones, and the sulfur capacity of the modified samples increased with the increment of Mn/Fe contents in the pyrolusite. Furthermore, the AC-H2O modified samples performed much higher desulfurization capacity (217 mg/g) than the AC-CO2 samples (171 mg/g).},

Current recycling technologies generally involve multi-steps such as acid leaching, precipitation, smelting, or solid-state sintering, and obtained products possess inferior electrochemical properties. The current work explores a new regeneration method for failed LiCoO2 cathode material. The electrochemical performance of LiCoO2 is fully recovered through a single thermal-chemical treatment of spent LiCoO2 in molten LiOH-KOH-Li2CO3 under air atmosphere. The molten salt mixture presents suitable dissolving capacity, homogeneous thermal circumstance, abundant Li+, and high ion diffusion rate to decompose impurities, compensate for Li+ deficiency, and repair damaged structure through a "dissolution-recrystallization"mechanism. Under the optimized reaction temperature of 500 {$^\circ$}C, the regenerated LiCoO2 possessed similar stoichiometric composition and crystalline structure of commercial LiCoO2. Importantly, the discharge capacity of spent LiCoO2 was recovered from 68.3 mA h g-1 to 144.5 mA h g-1, reaching the original level of commercial LiCoO2. Besides, the regenerated LiCoO2 also delivered superior cycling of 92.5\% capacity retention after 200 cycles and excellent rate performance.

It is demonstrated that CO2 can be effectively captured by molten carbonates, and subsequently electrochemically split into amorphous carbon on the cathode, and oxygen gas at the anode. The carbon materials generated at the cathode exhibit high BET surface areas of more than 400 m2 g-1 and as such, represent value-added products for a variety of applications such as energy storage and pollutant adsorption. In the carbonate eutectic (500 {$^\circ$}C), the presence of Li2CO3 is shown to be required for the deposition of carbon from the melt, wherein O2- or Li2O serves as the intermediate for CO2 capture and electrochemical conversion. SnO2 proved to be an effective anode for the electrochemical evolution of oxygen. Electrochemical reactions were found to proceed at relatively high current efficiencies, even though the current densities exceed 50 mA cm-2. The intrinsic nature of alkaline oxides for CO2 capture, the conversion of CO2 to value-added products, and the ability to drive the process with renewable energy sources such as solar power, enables the technology to be engineered for high flux capture and utilization of CO2.}

Moreover, the evaporation also exhibits superior salt resistant performance, and collected water meets World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water standards after purification from seawater. In addition, a small amount of photothermal material (1 wt\% CB) is required in this system, which is beneficial to reduce the cost of the system.

In this study, a novel process, based on a reduction thermal treatment and reductant-free acid leaching, for recycling valuable metals from spent LIBs has been developed. First, a thermodynamics calculation was performed to judge whether the reducing reaction between LiCoO2 and graphite can occur or not. Then, reduction thermal treatment experiments were conducted. The process was tested by a thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis method, and reaction products were measured by X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The experimental results agree well with thermodynamics analysis, and the desired CoO and Li2CO3 were obtained under the optimum processing conditions of 600 {$^\circ$}C, 120 min, and molar ratio of LiCoO2 to graphite of 2:1. Finally, almost 100\% Li and Co were easily leached from the reaction product under the conditions of 2.25 M H2SO4, 80 {$^\circ$}C, 30 min, and S/L = 100 g{$\cdot$}L-1, and Co and Li in the leaching liquor were further separated with 35\% PC88 at the ratio of aqueous to organic (A:O) equaling 0.5, 25 {$^\circ$}C, and pH = 5.5. The proposed approach can not only make full utilization of waste anode graphite, but also benefit leaching valuable metals in the absence of reductant, which significantly improves the economy and recovery performance of recycling spent LIBs.},

The recovery of cathode material is fully discussed due to its higher recovery value compared to other components. Several technologies are examined in every step to explore the promising route in terms of environmental protection, technological innovation, and economic feasibility.

Every year, various types of tyres are released in the environment from different vehicles, such as trucks, buses, cars, motorcycles, and bicycles, which negatively impact the environment. Nowadays, waste tyres are treated in several ways, whereas thermochemical conversion is one of them, including combustion, gasification, incineration, and pyrolysis. Many literatures revealed that pyrolysis is a more environmentally friendly process than others since it can convert waste tyres into crude oil, char, and syngas without emitting harmful gases. In this study, the pyrolysis of tyres and the chemical activation of tyres are reviewed in terms of their kinetic behaviour. According to the literature, the most influential factors of the pyrolysis process are reactors, temperature, heating rate, residence time, feedstock size and catalyst. As the main ingredient of the tyre is rubber, tyre pyrolysis starts from 300 {$^\circ$}C and completely decomposed nearly 550 {$^\circ$}C. It can be found from literature that Pyrolysed tyre can produce 30--65\% oil, 25--45\% char and 5--20 \% gas. It is also explained how the properties of active carbon (AC) are affected by activating conditions, including activation temperature, agent, the ratio of reagent mixture and others. Generally, pyrolytic char has surface area between 20 and 80 m2/g, whereas tyre-derived activated carbon's (TDAC) surface area varied from 90 to 970 m2/g. For large surface area and porous structure, TDAC has large application in purification and energy storage sector. The individuality of this article is to depict the entire pathway of AC production from waste tyres. The findings of this literature review help to improve technologies for producing activated carbon from waste tyres pyrolysed char.},

  abstract = {increased frequency of weather extremes and related energy and environmental issues affecting all living species on the planet. As a result, a CO 2-management scheme has been stimulated and proposed. To begin with, the development and deployment of carbon capture technologies has been widely acknowledged as a strong imperative for decarbonizing industry and promoting net CO 2 removal from the atmosphere. [4,5] Following the carbon capture, the conventional storage process, however, is unprofitable per se that requires large capital investment, heavily hindering its applicability in the commercial sector; meanwhile, more issues remain in the safety of underground and ocean CO 2 storage, while the potential locations are still under survey and assessment. A promising alternative to storage is the purposeful utilization of CO 2 as a renewable feedstock for producing high-value-added chemicals and fuels, which could not only curb carbon emissions but also provide a revenue stream that offsets capture costs and may even create positive cash flow. The conversion of CO 2 to chemicals and energy products using renewable resources such as solar, wind, and tide not only enables the storage of intermittent renewable energy in chemical bonds for easy transportation and efficient utilization , but also fulfills a transition from a liner carbon economy to a circular carbon-neutral economy for energy sustainability (Figure 1). [6,7] Recent years have witnessed the great progress in the realm of sustainable CO 2-management materials, especially centering on CO 2 capture, utilization, and catalytic conversion, contributing to a promising and potent solution to both emission-control and energy-supply challenges. However, there is a lack of a timely review on the state-of-the-art advances of holistic CO 2-management technologies from the material perspective. The purpose of this review is to provide a critical and complete overview of the main and emerging development of promising materials for sustainable CO 2 management. We give in-depth analyses of CO 2 capture, catalytic conversion, and direct use at numerous scales of material research, ranging from mechanism comprehension through targeted design and fabrication, property manipulation, to industrial implementation. Meanwhile , strategic considerations for both liquid and solid CO 2 capturing materials under various operational conditions as With the rising level of atmospheric CO 2 worsening climate change, a promising global movement toward carbon neutrality is forming. Sustainable CO 2 management based on carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has garnered considerable interest due to its critical role in resolving emission-control and energy-supply challenges. Here, a comprehensive review is presented that summarizes the state-of-the-art progress in developing promising materials for sustainable CO 2 management in terms of not only capture, catalytic conversion (thermochemistry, electrochemistry, photochemistry, and possible combinations), and direct utilization, but also emerging integrated capture and in situ conversion as well as artificial-intelligence-driven smart material study. In particular, insights that span multiple scopes of material research are offered, ranging from mechanistic comprehension of reactions, rational design and precise manipulation of key materials (e.g., carbon nanomate-rials, metal-organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, zeolites, ionic liquids), to industrial implementation. This review concludes with a summary and new perspectives, especially from multiple aspects of society, which summarizes major difficulties and future potential for implementing advanced materials and technologies in sustainable CO 2 management. This work may serve as a guideline and road map for developing CCU material systems, benefiting both scientists and engineers working in this growing and potentially game-changing area.}

To be qualified as a green medium, these solvents have to meet different criteria such as availability, non-toxicity, biodegradability, recyclability, flammability, and low price among others. Up to now, the number of available green solvents are rather limited. Here we wish to discuss a new family of ionic fluids, so-called Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES), that are now rapidly emerging in the current literature. A DES is a fluid generally composed of two or three cheap and safe components that are capable of self-association, often through hydrogen bond interactions, to form a eutectic mixture with a melting point lower than that of each individual component. DESs are generally liquid at temperatures lower than 100 {$^\circ$}C. These DESs exhibit similar physico-chemical properties to the traditionally used ionic liquids, while being much cheaper and environmentally friendlier. Owing to these remarkable advantages, DESs are now of growing interest in many fields of research. In this review, we report the major contributions of DESs in catalysis, organic synthesis, dissolution and extraction processes, electrochemistry and material chemistry. All works discussed in this review aim at demonstrating that DESs not only allow the design of eco-efficient processes but also open a straightforward access to new chemicals and materials.},

  abstract = {Carbon fiber reinforced carbon aerogel (C/CA) composites are promising lightweight insulators for the thermal protection of aerospace vehicles at ultra-high temperatures. However, it is seriously lack of understanding their oxidation behaviors despite its importance for the applications in oxygen-containing environments. Herein, we fabricate two kinds of C/CA using resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) and phenolic resin (PR) as precursors and investigate the effects of original and heat-treated skeletons on their oxidation behaviors. The results show that the composites derived from RF have the lower mass losses at 600-800 {$^\circ$}C after 35-min oxidation with an apparent activation energy of 50.80 kJ mol-1 than the counterparts derived from PR with the value of 40.14 kJ mol-1. It can be explained by the existence of more impurities and macropores as well as the larger residual tensile stress in C/CA from PR. The temperature-dependent oxidation morphology evolution is similar to the time-dependent evolution, changing from the gradually enlarged pores, to the formed grooves and even island-like structure. However, the composites from RF have reversely the higher mass losses when they were heat treated at 1600 and 2300 {$^\circ$}C, which is attributed to its relatively lower crystallinity and larger mesopore surface area. The significant increase in crystallinity and decrease in impurities and specific surface area are the main explanations for the remarkably lower oxidation rates after heat treatment. The oxidation behaviors of C/CA are jointly governed by the carbon-oxygen reaction and diffusion within pores; and the residual stress exerts a role to different extent.},

The C/S composite cathodes show high Coulombic efficiency, long cycling stability and good rate capability in the electrolyte of 1.0\>M LiPF6 + EC/DEC (1:1 v/v), for instance, the reversible capacity of the treated C/S-50 (50\% S) cathode retains around 860\>mAh/g even after 500 cycles and the Coulombic efficiency is close to 100\%, which demonstrates the best electrochemical performance of carbon-sulfur composite cathodes using the carbonate-based electrolyte reported to date. It is believed that the chemical bond of C-S is responsible for the superior electrochemical properties in Li-S battery, that is, the strong interaction between S and carbon matrix significantly improves the conductivity of S, effectively buffers the structural strain/stress caused by the large volume change during lithiation/delithiation, completely eliminates the formation of high-order polysulfide intermediates and substantially avoids the shuttle reaction and the side reaction between polysulfide anions and carbonate solvent and thus enables the C/S cathode to use conventional carbonate-based electrolytes and achieve outstanding electrochemical properties in Li-S battery. The results may substantially contribute to the progress of the Li-S battery technology.},

  abstract = {Continuing miniaturization of flexible electronics demands the generation of microscale fiber-shaped supercapacitor electrodes with high mechanical flexibility and durability, charge-discharge rate, and cycling stability. For this purpose, here, a novel nanostructured microfiber is fabricated from hyaluronic acid (HA), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and polyaniline (PANI) by a combination of wet spinning and electrochemical polymerization. The obtained core-shell HA/CNT/PANI fibers show an average six fold increase in specific capacitance compared to HA/CNT fibers and approximately 90\% capacitance retention over 3000 cycles at 100 mV s-1. The cycling stability is higher than that reported for PANI without the HA/CNT core. In addition, the core-shell HA/CNT/PANI microfiber displays excellent flexibility and electrochemical cycling stability under bending and twisting, showing flexibility and wearability. The exceptional results originate from the PANI's high pseudocapcitance in addition to the wet-spun HA/CNT core fiber's role as a highly conductive and mechanically superior base material. This work shows the suitability of HA/CNT/PANI fibers as supercapacitor electrodes for applications in flexible and wearable electronics.}

  abstract = {In present work, we present a novel deep eutectic solvent electrolyte for supercapacitors simply by mixing choline chloride and ethylene glycol. It unveils that the molar ratio of choline chloride and ethylene glycol exerts crucial effect on the viscosity, electrical conductivity and capacitive behaviors under extreme conditions (-40--115 {$^\circ$}C). With the increase of temperature, the viscosity of electrolyte decreases along with the enhancement of electrical conductivity; similar phenomenon toward capacitive behaviors under extreme conditions also occurs. The electrolyte with molar ratio of 1:2 (choline chloride:ethylene glycol) under 115 {$^\circ$}C shows a specific capacitance of 362 F g-1 (with energy density of 50.33 Wh kg-1), which can remain as 102 F g-1 (with energy density of 14.13 Wh kg-1) even at -40 {$^\circ$}C. In addition, density functional theory also confirms that the electrolyte with molar ratio of 1:2 has larger absolute value of adsorption energy as 4.42 eV. The present deep eutectic solvent by choline chloride and ethylene glycol can extend to other electrolytes especially for wide temperature range supercapacitors.}

  abstract = {The extensive use of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in new electric vehicles has effectively alleviated the problems of insufficient oil and gas resources and environmental pollution. It is of great significance to realize the goals of "carbon neutrality" and "carbon peaking." As the key and last link in the use of power batteries, recycling waste LIBs is conducive to realizing resource return and avoiding pollution and potential risks of toxic and harmful substances in the environment. With the efforts of many researchers, the harmless treatment and resource recovery process of spent LIBs has been maturing. In recent years, some new recycling processes have appeared frequently to solve the problems of high energy consumption and secondary pollution in the traditional approach. Among these new technologies, green and inexpensive deep-eutectic solvents (DESs) have been particularly attractive due to their excellent selectivity and leaching efficiency. This review summarizes the dissolution mechanism of valuable metals from LIB cathode materials using DESs. At the same time, the advantages and challenges faced by DESs in cathode material recycling were analyzed, and an outlook was presented for the future development of DESs in the field of battery recycling.},

The three-dimensional (3D) N, S dual-doped CQDs/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/NiCo2S4 composite aerogel (N,S-CQDs/rGO/NiCo2S4) is first fabricated through a one-pot hydrothermal way and utilized as a supercapacitor cathode, exhibiting a large specific capacity of 162.6 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1, splendid rate property with 77.3\% capacity retention at 50 A g-1, and good cyclic stability with 87.5\% capacity retention after 5000 cycles, which originates from the synergistic interaction of the 3D reticulation N,S-CQDs/rGO aerogel framework with excellent conductivity and structural stability and NiCo2S4 nanoparticles with abundant Faradaic redox reactions. Further, the resulting N,S-CQDs/rGO/NiCo2S4 cathode is coupled with the prepared N,S-CQDs/rGO anode to assemble a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device, manifesting a superior energy density (51.0 W h kg-1), an ultrahigh power density (14.4 kW kg-1), and good cyclic stability with 82.9\% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles.
